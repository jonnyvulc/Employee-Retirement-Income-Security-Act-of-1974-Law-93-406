****** * TITLE I—PROTECTION OF EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RIGHTS 14
SUBTITLE A—GENERAL PROVISIONS FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY
SEC. 2. ø1001¿ (a) The Congress finds that the growth in size, scope, and numbers of employee benefit plans in recent years has been rapid and substantial; that the operational scope and eco- nomic impact of such plans is increasingly interstate; that the con- tinued well-being and security of millions of employees and their dependents are directly affected by these plans; that they are af- fected with a national public interest; that they have become an important factor affecting the stability of employment and the suc- cessful development of industrial relations; that they have become an important factor in commerce because of the interstate char- acter of their activities, and of the activities of their participants, and the employers, employee organizations, and other entities by which they are established or maintained; that a large volume of the activities of such plans is carried on by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; that owing to the lack of employee information and adequate safeguards concerning their op- eration, it is desirable in the interests of employees and their bene- ficiaries, and to provide for the general welfare and the free flow of commerce, that disclosure be made and safeguards be provided with respect to the establishment, operation, and administration of such plans; that they substantially affect the revenues of the United States because they are afforded preferential Federal tax treatment; that despite the enormous growth in such plans many employees with long years of employment are losing anticipated re- tirement benefits owing to the lack of vesting provisions in such plans; that owing to the inadequacy of current minimum standards,

plans; that owing to the inadequacy of current minimum standards, the soundness and stability of plans with respect to adequate funds to pay promised benefits may be endangered; that owing to the ter- mination of plans before requisite funds have been accumulated, employees and their beneficiaries have been deprived of anticipated benefits; and that it is therefore desirable in the interests of em- ployees and their beneficiaries, for the protection of the revenue of the United States, and to provide for the free flow of commerce, that minimum standards be provided assuring the equitable char- acter of such plans and their financial soundness.
(b) It is hereby declared to be the policy of this Act to protect interstate commerce and the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries, by requiring the disclosure and reporting to participants and beneficiaries of financial and other information with respect thereto, by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.
(c) It is hereby further declared to be the policy of this Act to protect interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and the in- terests of participants in private pension plans and their bene- ficiaries by improving the equitable character and the soundness of such plans by requiring them to vest the accrued benefits of em- ployees with significant periods of service, to meet minimum stand- ards of funding, and by requiring plan termination insurance.
DEFINITIONS
SEC. 3. ø1002¿ For purposes of this title:
(1) The terms ‘‘employee welfare benefit plan’’ and ‘‘welfare plan’’ mean any plan, fund, or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an em- ployee organization, or by both, to the extent that such plan, fund, or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of pro- viding for its participants or their beneficiaries, through the pur- chase of insurance or otherwise, (A) medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, dis- ability, death or unemployment, or vacation benefits, apprentice- ship or other training programs, or day care centers, scholarship funds, or prepaid legal services, or (B) any benefit described in sec- tion 302(c) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 ø(29 U.S.C. 186(c))¿ (other than pensions on retirement or death, and insurance to provide such pensions).
(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the terms ‘‘em- ployee pension benefit plan’’ and ‘‘pension plan’’ mean any plan, fund, or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization, or by both, to the extent that by its express terms or as a result of surrounding circumstances such plan, fund, or program—
(i) provides retirement income to employees, or
(ii) results in a deferral of income by employees for periods extending to the termination of covered employment or beyond, regardless of the method of calculating the contributions made to the plan, the method of calculating the benefits under the plan or the method of distributing benefits from the plan. A distribution

from a plan, fund, or program shall not be treated as made in a form other than retirement income or as a distribution prior to ter- mination of covered employment solely because such distribution is made to an employee who has attained age 62 and who is not sepa- rated from employment at the time of such distribution.
(B) The Secretary may by regulation prescribe rules consistent with the standards and purposes of this Act providing one or more exempt categories under which—
(i) severance pay arrangements, and
(ii) supplemental retirement income payments, under which the pension benefits of retirees or their beneficiaries are supplemented to take into account some portion or all of the increases in the cost of living (as determined by the Secretary of Labor) since retirement,
shall, for purposes of this title, be treated as welfare plans rather than pension plans. In the case of any arrangement or payment a principal effect of which is the evasion of the standards or purposes of this Act applicable to pension plans, such arrangement or pay- ment shall be treated as a pension plan. An applicable voluntary early retirement incentive plan (as defined in section 457(e)(11)(D)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) making pay- ments or supplements described in section 457(e)(11)(D)(i) of such Code, and an applicable employment retention plan (as defined in section 457(f)(4)(C) of such Code) making payments of benefits de- scribed in section 457(f)(4)(A) of such Code, shall, for purposes of this title, be treated as a welfare plan (and not a pension plan) with respect to such payments and supplements.
(C) 15 A pooled employer plan shall be treated as—
(i) a single employee pension benefit plan or single
pension plan; and
(ii) a plan to which section 210(a) applies.

This clause shall apply without regard to whether the provision of such lifetime in- come stream equivalent is required by subparagraph (B)(iii).

(C) A right to an accrued benefit derived from employer contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because plan amendments may be given retroactive application as pro- vided in section 302(d)(2).
(D)(i) A right to an accrued benefit derived from employer contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that, in the case of a participant who does not have a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of his ac- crued benefit derived from employer contributions, such ac- crued benefit may be forfeited on account of the withdrawal by the participant of any amount attributable to the benefit de- rived from mandatory contributions (as defined in the last sen- tence of section 204(c)(2)(C)) made by such participant.
(ii) Clause (i) shall not apply to a plan unless the plan pro- vides that any accrued benefit forfeited under a plan provision described in such clause shall be restored upon repayment by the participant of the full amount of the withdrawal described in such clause plus, in the case of a defined benefit plan, inter- est. Such interest shall be computed on such amount at the rate determined for purposes of section 204(c)(2)(C) (if such subsection applies) on the date of such repayment (computed annually from the date of such withdrawal). The plan provision required under this clause may provide that such repayment must be made (I) in the case of a withdrawal on account of sep- aration from service, before the earlier of 5 years after the first date on which the participant is subsequently re-employed by the employer, or the close of the first period of 5 consecutive 1-year breaks in service commencing after the withdrawal; or (II) in the case of any other withdrawal, 5 years after the date of the withdrawal.
(iii) In the case of accrued benefits derived from employer contributions which accrued before the date of the enactment of this Act øSeptember 2, 1974¿, a right to such accrued ben- efit derived from employer contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that an amount of such accrued benefit may be forfeited on account of the with- drawal by the participant of an amount attributable to the ben- efit derived from mandatory contributions, made by such par- ticipant before the date of the enactment of this Act øSep- tember 2, 1974¿ if such amount forfeited is proportional to such amount withdrawn. This clause shall not apply to any plan to which any mandatory contribution is made after the date of the enactment of this Act øSeptember 2, 1974¿. The Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this clause.
(iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, in the case of any class-year plan, a withdrawal of employee contributions shall be treated as a withdrawal of such contributions on a plan year by plan year basis in succeeding order of time.
(v) CROSS REFERENCE.—For nonforfeitability where the employee has a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of his accrued benefit, see section 206(c).
(E)(i) A right to an accrued benefit derived from employer contributions under a multiemployer plan shall not be treated

(ii) A participant’s right to an accrued benefit derived from employer contributions under a multiemployer plan shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because—
(I) the plan is amended to reduce benefits under sec- tion 4244A or 4281, or
(II) benefit payments under the plan may be sus- pended under section 4245 or 4281.
(F) A matching contribution (within the meaning of section
401(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall not be treated as forfeitable merely because such contribution is for- feitable if the contribution to which the matching contribution relates is treated as an excess contribution under section 401(k)(8)(B) of such Code, an excess deferral under section 402(g)(2)(A) of such Code, an erroneous automatic contribution under section 414(w) of such Code, or an excess aggregate con- tribution under section 401(m)(6)(B) of such Code.
(b)(1) In computing the period of service under the plan for purposes of determining the nonforfeitable percentage under sub- section (a)(2), all of an employee’s years of service with the em- ployer or employers maintaining the plan shall be taken into ac- count, except that the following may be disregarded:
(A) years of service before age 18, 32
(B) years of service during a period for which the employee
declined to contribute to a plan requiring employee contribu- tions;
(C) years of service with an employer during any period for which the employer did not maintain the plan or a predecessor plan, defined by the Secretary of the Treasury;
(D) service not required to be taken into account under paragraph (3);
(E) years of service before January 1, 1971, unless the em- ployee has had at least 3 years of service after December 31, 1970;
(F) years of service before this part first applies to the plan if such service would have been disregarded under the rules of the plan with regard to breaks in service, as in effect on the applicable date; and
(G) in the case of a multiemployer plan, years of service— (i) with an employer after—
(I) a complete withdrawal of such employer from the plan (within the meaning of section 4203), or
(II) to the extent permitted by regulations pre- scribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, a partial withdrawal described in section 4205(b)(2)(A)(i) of this title in connection with the decertification of the collec- tive bargaining representative; and

(ii) the number of years (not in excess of 331⁄3) of his par- ticipation in the plan.
In the case of a plan providing retirement benefits based on com- pensation during any period, the normal retirement benefit to which a participant would be entitled shall be determined as if he continued to earn annually the average rate of compensation which he earned during consecutive years of service, not in excess of 10, for which his compensation was the highest.

subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.
(B) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph of a particular plan year if under the plan the accrued benefit payable at the normal retirement age is equal to the normal retirement benefit and the annual rate at which any individual who is or could be a participant can accrue the retirement benefits payable at normal retirement age under the plan for any later plan year is not more than 1331⁄3 percent of the annual rate at which he can accrue benefits for any plan year beginning on or after such particular plan year and before such later plan year. For purposes of this subparagraph—
(i) any amendment to the plan which is in effect for the current year shall be treated as in effect for all other plan years;
(ii) any change in an accrual rate which does not apply to any individual who is or could be a participant in the current year shall be disregarded;
(iii) the fact that benefits under the plan may be payable to certain employees before normal retirement age shall be dis- regarded; and
(iv) social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining con- stant as of the current year for all years after the current year. (C) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this
paragraph if the accrued benefit to which any participant is enti- tled upon his separation from the service is not less than a fraction of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age to which he would be entitled under the plan as in effect on the date of his separation if he continued to earn annually until normal re- tirement age the same rate of compensation upon which his normal retirement benefit would be computed under the plan, determined as if he had attained normal retirement age on the date any such determination is made (but taking into account no more than the 10 years of service immediately preceding his separation from serv- ice). Such fraction shall be a fraction, not exceeding 1, the numer- ator of which is the total number of his years of participation in the plan (as of the date of his separation from the service) and the denominator of which is the total number of years he would have participated in the plan if he separated from the service at the nor- mal retirement age. For purposes of this subparagraph, social secu- rity benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.
(D) Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) shall not apply with re- spect to years of participation before the first plan year to which this section applies but a defined benefit plan satisfies the require- ments of this subparagraph with respect to such years of participa- tion only if the accrued benefit of any participant with respect to such years of participation is not less than the greater of—

(E) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this
paragraph, a plan shall not be treated as not satisfying the require- ments of this paragraph solely because the accrual of benefits under the plan does not become effective until the employee has two continuous years of service. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ‘‘year of service’’ has the meaning provided by section 202(a)(3)(A).

(i) is funded exclusively by the purchase of insurance con- tracts, and
(ii) satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 301(b) (relating to certain insurance contract plans),

(ii) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the require- ments of this subparagraph solely because the plan imposes (with- out regard to age) a limitation on the amount of benefits that the plan provides or a limitation on the number of years of service or years of participation which are taken into account for purposes of determining benefit accrual under the plan.
(iii) In the case of any employee who, as of the end of any plan year under a defined benefit plan, has attained normal retirement age under such plan—
(I) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has commenced as of the end of such plan year, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such em- ployee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of in-service distribution of benefits, and

(C) For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of any employee whose service is less than 1,000 hours during any calendar year, plan year or other 12-consecutive-month period designated by the plan (and not prohibited under regulations prescribed by the Sec- retary) the calculation of his period of service shall not be treated as not made on a reasonable and consistent basis merely because such service is not taken into account.

(A) COMPARISON TO SIMILARLY SITUATED YOUNGER IN-
DIVIDUAL.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—A plan shall not be treated as
failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H)(i) if a participant’s accrued benefit, as determined as of any date under the terms of the plan, would be equal to or greater than that of any similarly situated, younger individual who is or could be a participant.
(ii) SIMILARLY SITUATED.—For purposes of this subparagraph, a participant is similarly situated to any other individual if such participant is identical to such other individual in every respect (including pe- riod of service, compensation, position, date of hire, work history, and any other respect) except for age.
(iii) DISREGARD OF SUBSIDIZED EARLY RETIREMENT BENEFITS.—In determining the accrued benefit as of any date for purposes of this subparagraph, the sub-
34 Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) section 701 provides generally that the provisions apply to periods after 6/29/05, but allows for delay of the effective date for collectively bargained plans until as late as 1/1/2010.

(B) APPLICABLE DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS.—
(i) INTEREST CREDITS.—
(I) IN GENERAL.—An applicable defined ben-
efit plan shall be treated as failing to meet the re- quirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the terms of the plan provide that any interest credit (or an equivalent amount) for any plan year shall be at a rate which is not greater than a market rate of return. A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subclause merely because the plan provides for a reasonable min- imum guaranteed rate of return or for a rate of re- turn that is equal to the greater of a fixed or vari- able rate of return.
(II) PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL.—An applicable defined benefit plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the plan provides that an interest credit (or equiv- alent amount) of less than zero shall in no event result in the account balance or similar amount being less than the aggregate amount of contribu- tions credited to the account.
(III) MARKET RATE OF RETURN.—The Sec- retary of the Treasury may provide by regulation for rules governing the calculation of a market rate of return for purposes of subclause (I) and for permissible methods of crediting interest to the account (including fixed or variable interest rates) resulting in effective rates of return meeting the requirements of subclause (I).
(ii) SPECIAL RULE FOR PLAN CONVERSIONS.—If,
after June 29, 2005, an applicable plan amendment is adopted, the plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the re- quirements of clause (iii) are met with respect to each individual who was a participant in the plan imme- diately before the adoption of the amendment.
(iii) RATE OF BENEFIT ACCRUAL.—Subject to clause (iv), the requirements of this clause are met with re- spect to any participant if the accrued benefit of the participant under the terms of the plan as in effect after the amendment is not less than the sum of—

(iv) SPECIAL RULES FOR EARLY RETIREMENT SUB-
SIDIES.—For purposes of clause (iii)(I), the plan shall credit the accumulation account or similar amount with the amount of any early retirement benefit or re- tirement-type subsidy for the plan year in which the participant retires if, as of such time, the participant has met the age, years of service, and other require- ments under the plan for entitlement to such benefit or subsidy.

(I) IN GENERAL.—The term ‘‘applicable plan amendment’’ means an amendment to a defined benefit plan which has the effect of converting the plan to an applicable defined benefit plan.
(II) SPECIAL RULE FOR COORDINATED BENE- FITS.—If the benefits of 2 or more defined benefit plans established or maintained by an employer are coordinated in such a manner as to have the effect of the adoption of an amendment described in subclause (I), the sponsor of the defined benefit plan or plans providing for such coordination shall be treated as having adopted such a plan amend- ment as of the date such coordination begins.
(III) MULTIPLE AMENDMENTS.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue regulations to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this subpara- graph through the use of 2 or more plan amend- ments rather than a single amendment.
(IV) APPLICABLE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN.—For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ‘‘applica- ble defined benefit plan’’ has the meaning given such term by section 203(f)(3).
(vi) TERMINATION REQUIREMENTS.—An applicable
defined benefit plan shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of clause (i) unless the plan provides that, upon the termination of the plan—
(I) if the interest credit rate (or an equivalent amount) under the plan is a variable rate, the rate of interest used to determine accrued benefits under the plan shall be equal to the average of the rates of interest used under the plan during the 5- year period ending on the termination date, and
(II) the interest rate and mortality table used to determine the amount of any benefit under the plan payable in the form of an annuity payable at normal retirement age shall be the rate and table specified under the plan for such purpose as of the termination date, except that if such interest rate

is a variable rate, the interest rate shall be deter-
mined under the rules of subclause (I).
(C) CERTAIN OFFSETS PERMITTED.—A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H)(i) solely because the plan provides offsets against benefits under the plan to the extent such offsets are oth- erwise allowable in applying the requirements of section
401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
(D) PERMITTED DISPARITIES IN PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS OR
BENEFITS.—A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) solely because the plan provides a disparity in contributions or benefits with respect to which the requirements of section 401(l) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are met.
(E) INDEXING PERMITTED.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—A plan shall not be treated as
failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) solely because the plan provides for indexing of ac- crued benefits under the plan.
(ii) PROTECTION AGAINST LOSS.—Except in the case of any benefit provided in the form of a variable annu- ity, clause (i) shall not apply with respect to any in- dexing which results in an accrued benefit less than the accrued benefit determined without regard to such indexing.
(iii) INDEXING.—For purposes of this subpara- graph, the term ‘‘indexing’’ means, in connection with an accrued benefit, the periodic adjustment of the ac- crued benefit by means of the application of a recog- nized investment index or methodology.
(F) EARLY RETIREMENT BENEFIT OR RETIREMENT-TYPE
SUBSIDY.—For purposes of this paragraph, the terms ‘‘early retirement benefit’’ and ‘‘retirement-type subsidy’’ have the meaning given such terms in subsection (g)(2)(A).

(c)(1) For purposes of this section and section 203 an employ- ee’s accrued benefit derived from employer contributions as of any applicable date is the excess (if any) of the accrued benefit for such employee as of such applicable date over the accrued benefit de- rived from contributions made by such employee as of such date.
(2)(A) In the case of a plan other than a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an em- ployee as of any applicable date is—

(B) DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS.—In the case of a defined benefit
plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is the amount equal to the em- ployee’s accumulated contributions expressed as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, using an interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 205(g)(3) (as of the de- termination date).
(C) For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘accumulated con- tributions’’ means the total of—

an amount other than an annual benefit commencing at normal re- tirement age, or if the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee is to be determined with respect to a benefit other than an annual benefit in the form of a single life annuity (without ancillary benefits) commencing at normal retirement age, the employee’s accrued benefit, or the accrued benefits derived from contributions made by an employee, as the case may be, shall be the actuarial equivalent of such benefit or amount determined under paragraph (1) or (2).
(4) In the case of a defined benefit plan which permits vol- untary employee contributions, the portion of an employee’s ac- crued benefit derived from such contributions shall be treated as an accrued benefit derived from employee contributions under a plan other than a defined benefit plan.
(d) Notwithstanding section 203(b)(1), for purposes of deter- mining the employee’s accrued benefit under the plan, the plan may disregard service performed by the employee with respect to which he has received—
(1) a distribution of the present value of his entire non- forfeitable benefit if such distribution was in an amount (not more than the dollar limit under section 203(e)(1)) permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, or
(2) a distribution of the present value of his nonforfeitable benefit attributable to such service which he elected to receive. Paragraph (1) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee’s participation in the plan. Paragraph (2) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee’s participation in the plan or under such other cir- cumstances as may be provided under regulations prescribed by the
Secretary of the Treasury.
(e) For purposes of determining the employee’s accrued benefit,
the plan shall not disregard service as provided in subsection (d) unless the plan provides an opportunity for the participant to repay the full amount of a distribution described in subsection (d) with, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest at the rate deter- mined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C) and provides that upon such repayment the employee’s accrued benefit shall be recomputed by taking into account service so disregarded. This subsection shall apply only in the case of a participant who—
(1) received such a distribution in any plan year to which this section applies, which distribution was less than the present value of his accrued benefit,
(2) resumes employment covered under the plan, and
(3) repays the full amount of such distribution with, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C).
The plan provision required under this subsection may provide that such repayment must be made (A) in the case of a withdrawal on account of separation from service, before the earlier of 5 years after the first date on which the participant is subsequently re-em- ployed by the employer, or the close of the first period of 5 consecu- tive 1-year breaks in service commencing after the withdrawal; or

(f) For the purposes of this part, an employer shall be treated as maintaining a plan if any employee of such employer accrues benefits under such plan by reason of service with such employer.
(g)(1) The accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan, other than an amendment described in section 302(d)(2) or 4281.

(A) eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a retirement-type subsidy (as defined in regulations), or
(B) eliminating an optional form of benefit,
with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amend- ment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits. In the case of a retirement-type subsidy, the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to a participant who satisfies (either before or after the amendment) the preamendment conditions for the subsidy. The Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulations provide that this paragraph shall not apply to any plan amendment which reduces or eliminates benefits or subsidies which create significant burdens or complexities for the plan and plan participants, unless such amendment adversely affects the rights of any participant in a more than de minimis manner. The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations provide that this subparagraph shall not apply to a plan amendment described in subparagraph (B) (other than a plan amendment having an effect described in subparagraph (A)).
(3) For purposes of this subsection, any—
(A) tax credit employee stock ownership plan (as defined
in section 409(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), or
(B) employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section
4975(e)(7) of such Code),
shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this sub- section merely because it modifies distribution options in a non- discriminatory manner.

(i) the forms of distribution previously available under the transferor plan applied to the account of a participant or bene- ficiary under the transferor plan that was transferred from the transferor plan to the transferee plan pursuant to a direct transfer rather than pursuant to a distribution from the trans- feror plan;
(ii) the terms of both the transferor plan and the trans- feree plan authorize the transfer described in clause (i);
(iii) the transfer described in clause (i) was made pursuant to a voluntary election by the participant or beneficiary whose account was transferred to the transferee plan;

This paragraph shall not apply to the elimination of a form of distribution with respect to any partici- pant unless—
(A) a single sum payment is available to such participant at the same time or times as the form of distribution being eliminated; and
(B) such single sum payment is based on the same or greater portion of the participant’s account as the form of dis- tribution being eliminated.

to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual unless the plan administrator provides the notice described in paragraph (2) to each applicable individual (and to each em- ployee organization representing applicable individuals) and to each employer who has an obligation to contribute to the plan.
(2) The notice required by paragraph (1) shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan partici- pant and shall provide sufficient information (as determined in ac- cordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treas- ury) to allow applicable individuals to understand the effect of the plan amendment. The Secretary of the Treasury may provide a simplified form of notice for, or exempt from any notice require- ment, a plan—
(A) which has fewer than 100 participants who have ac- crued a benefit under the plan, or
(B) which offers participants the option to choose between the new benefit formula and the old benefit formula.
(3) Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, the notice required by paragraph (1) shall be provided within a reasonable time before the effective date of the plan amendment.
(4) Any notice under paragraph (1) may be provided to a per- son designated, in writing, by the person to which it would other- wise be provided.
(5) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the require- ments of paragraph (1) merely because notice is provided before the adoption of the plan amendment if no material modification of the amendment occurs before the amendment is adopted.

(4)37 A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the require- ments of paragraph (1)(C) or (2) merely because the plan provides that benefits will not be payable to the surviving spouse of the par- ticipant unless the participant and such spouse had been married throughout the 1-year period ending on the earlier of the partici- pant’s annuity starting date or the date of the participant’s death.
(c)(1) A plan meets the requirements of this section only if— (A) 38 under the plan, each participant—
(i) may elect at any time during the applicable election period to waive the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit or the qualified preretirement survivor an- nuity form of benefit (or both),

(B) it is established to the satisfaction of a plan represent- ative that the consent required under subparagraph (A) may not be obtained because there is no spouse, because the spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations prescribe.
Any consent by a spouse (or establishment that the consent of a spouse may not be obtained) under the preceding sentence shall be effective only with respect to such spouse.

annuity form of benefit,

(iv) the right to make, and the effect of, a revocation of an
election under paragraph (1).
(B)(i) Each plan shall provide to each participant, within the applicable period with respect to such participant (and consistent with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe), a written explanation with respect to the qualified preretirement survivor annuity comparable to that required under subparagraph (A).
(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the term ‘‘applicable period’’ means, with respect to a participant, whichever of the following pe- riods ends last:

(4) Each plan shall provide that, if this section applies to a par- ticipant when part or all of the participant’s accrued benefit is to be used as security for a loan, no portion of the participant’s ac- crued benefit may be used as security for such loan unless—
(A) the spouse of the participant (if any) consents in writ- ing to such use during the 90-day period ending on the date on which the loan is to be so secured, and
(B) requirements comparable to the requirements of para- graph (2) are met with respect to such consent.
(5)(A) The requirements of this subsection shall not apply with
respect to the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit or the qualified preretirement survivor annuity form of benefit, as the case may be, if such benefit may not be waived (or another ben- eficiary selected) and if the plan fully subsidizes the costs of such benefit.
(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a plan fully subsidizes the costs of a benefit if under the plan the failure to waive such benefit by a participant would not result in a decrease in any plan benefits with respect to such participant and would not result in increased contributions from such participant.

OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO FORM AND PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
SEC. 206. ø1056¿ (a) Each pension plan shall provide that un- less the participant otherwise elects, the payment of benefits under the plan to the participant shall begin not later than the 60th day after the latest of the close of the plan year in which—
(1) occurs the date on which the participant attains the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan,
(2) occurs the 10th anniversary of the year in which the participant commenced participation in the plan, or
(3) the participant terminates his service with the em- ployer.
In the case of a plan which provides for the payment of an early retirement benefit, such plan shall provide that a participant who satisfied the service requirements for such early retirement benefit, but separated from the service (with any nonforfeitable right to an accrued benefit) before satisfying the age requirement for such early retirement benefit, is entitled upon satisfaction of such age requirement to receive a benefit not less than the benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age, actuarially re- duced under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treas- ury.
(b) If—
(1) a participant or beneficiary is receiving benefits under
a pension plan, or
(2) a participant is separated from the service and has
non-forfeitable rights to benefits,
a plan may not decrease benefits of such a participant by reason of any increase in the benefit levels payable under title II of the Social Security Act ø(42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.)¿ or the Railroad Retire- ment Act of 1937 øRailroad Retirement Act of 1974 (45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.)¿42 or any increase in the wage base43 under such title II, if such increase takes place after the date of the enactment of this Act øSeptember 2, 1974¿ or (if later) the earlier of the date of first entitlement of such benefits or the date of such separation.
(c) No pension plan may provide that any part of a partici- pant’s accrued benefit derived from employer contributions (wheth- er or not otherwise nonforfeitable) is forfeitable solely because of withdrawal by such participant of any amount attributable to the

domestic relations order—
(I) which creates or recognizes the existence of an al-
ternate payee’s right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan, and
(II) with respect to which the requirements of sub- paragraphs (C) and (D) are met, and
(ii) the term ‘‘domestic relations order’’ means any judg-
ment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settle- ment agreement) which—
(I) relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant, and
(II) is made pursuant to a State or Tribal domestic re- lations law (including a community property law).
For purposes of clause (ii), the term ‘‘Tribal’’ with respect to a do- mestic relations law means such a law which is issued by or under the laws of an Indian tribal government, a subdivision of such an Indian tribal government, or an agency or instrumentality of ei- ther.

(determined on the basis of actuarial value), and
(iii) does not require the payment of benefits to an alter-
nate payee which are required to be paid to another alternate payee under another order previously determined to be a quali- fied domestic relations order.
(E)(i) A domestic relations order shall not be treated as failing
to meet the requirements of clause (i) of subparagraph (D) solely because such order requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee—
(I) in the case of any payment before a participant has sep- arated from service, on or after the date on which the partici- pant attains (or would have attained) the earliest retirement age,
(II) as if the participant had retired on the date on which such payment is to begin under such order (but taking into ac- count only the present value of benefits actually accrued and not taking into account the present value of any employer sub- sidy for early retirement), and
(III) in any form in which such benefits may be paid under the plan to the participant (other than in the form of a joint and survivor annuity with respect to the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse).
For purposes of subclause (II), the interest rate assumption used in determining the present value shall be the interest rate specified in the plan or, if no rate is specified, 5 percent. (ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ‘‘earliest re-
tirement age’’ means the earlier of—
(I) the date on which the participant is entitled to a dis-
tribution under the plan, or
(II) the later of the date of the participant attains age 50
or the earliest date on which the participant could begin re- ceiving benefits under the plan if the participant separated from service.
(F) To the extent provided in any qualified domestic relations
order—
(i) the former spouse of a participant shall be treated as
a surviving spouse of such participant for purposes of section 205 (and any spouse of the participant shall not be treated as a spouse of the participant for such purposes), and

a plan—
(I) the plan administrator shall promptly notify the partici-
pant and each alternate payee of the receipt of such order and the plan’s procedures for determining the qualified status of domestic relations orders, and
(II) within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the plan administrator shall determine whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order and notify the participant and each alternate payee of such determination.

mestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined (by the plan administrator, by a court of com- petent jurisdiction, or otherwise), the plan administrator shall sep- arately account for the amounts (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the ‘‘segregated amounts’’) which would have been payable to the alternate payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.
(ii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v) the order (or modification thereof) is determined to be a qualified do- mestic relations order, the plan administrator shall pay the seg- regated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled thereto.
(iii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v)—
(I) it is determined that the order is not a qualified domes-
tic relations order, or
(II) the issue as to whether such order is a qualified do-
mestic relations order is not resolved,
then the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (in- cluding any interest thereon) to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.
(iv) Any determination that an order is a qualified domestic re- lations order which is made after the close of the 18-month period described in clause (v) shall be applied prospectively only.
(v) For purposes of this subparagraph, the 18-month period de- scribed in this clause is the 18-month period beginning with the date on which the first payment would be required to be made under the domestic relations order.

(iii) ENFORCEMENT.—Any security provided under clause (i) may be perfected and enforced at any time after the earlier of—
(I) the date on which the plan terminates,
(II) if there is a failure to make a payment of the minimum required contribution for any plan year beginning after the security is provided, the due date for the payment under section 303(j), or
(III) if the adjusted funding target attainment percentage is less than 60 percent for a consecu- tive period of 7 years, the valuation date for the last year in the period.
(iv) RELEASE OF SECURITY.—The security shall be
released (and any amounts thereunder shall be re- funded together with any interest accrued thereon) at such time as the Secretary of the Treasury may pre- scribe in regulations, including regulations for partial releases of the security by reason of increases in the adjusted funding target attainment percentage.
(B) PREFUNDING BALANCE OR FUNDING STANDARD CAR- RYOVER BALANCE MAY NOT BE USED.—No prefunding bal- ance or funding standard carryover balance under section 303(f) may be used under paragraph (1), (2), or (4) to sat- isfy any payment an employer may make under any such paragraph to avoid or terminate the application of any lim- itation under such paragraph.
(C) DEEMED REDUCTION OF FUNDING BALANCES.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—Subject to clause (iii), in any case in which a benefit limitation under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) would (but for this subparagraph and deter- mined without regard to paragraph (1)(B), (2)(B), or (4)(B)) apply to such plan for the plan year, the plan sponsor of such plan shall be treated for purposes of this Act as having made an election under section 303(f) to reduce the prefunding balance or funding standard carryover balance by such amount as is nec- essary for such benefit limitation to not apply to the
plan for such plan year.
(ii) EXCEPTION FOR INSUFFICIENT FUNDING BAL-
ANCES.—Clause (i) shall not apply with respect to a benefit limitation for any plan year if the application of clause (i) would not result in the benefit limitation not applying for such plan year.

(7) PRESUMED UNDERFUNDING FOR PURPOSES OF BENEFIT LIMITATIONS.—
(A) PRESUMPTION OF CONTINUED UNDERFUNDING.—In any case in which a benefit limitation under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) has been applied to a plan with respect to the plan year preceding the current plan year, the ad- justed funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the current plan year shall be presumed to be equal to the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan for the preceding plan year until the enrolled actuary of the plan certifies the actual adjusted funding target attain- ment percentage of the plan for the current plan year.
(B) PRESUMPTION OF UNDERFUNDING AFTER 10TH MONTH.—In any case in which no certification of the ad- justed funding target attainment percentage for the cur- rent plan year is made with respect to the plan before the first day of the 10th month of such year, for purposes of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4), such first day shall be deemed, for purposes of such paragraph, to be the valu- ation date of the plan for the current plan year and the plan’s adjusted funding target attainment percentage shall be conclusively presumed to be less than 60 percent as of such first day.
(C) PRESUMPTION OF UNDERFUNDING AFTER 4TH MONTH FOR NEARLY UNDERFUNDED PLANS.—In any case in which— (i) a benefit limitation under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) did not apply to a plan with respect to the plan year preceding the current plan year, but the ad- justed funding target attainment percentage of the plan for such preceding plan year was not more than 10 percentage points greater than the percentage which would have caused such paragraph to apply to the plan with respect to such preceding plan year, and (ii) as of the first day of the 4th month of the cur- rent plan year, the enrolled actuary of the plan has not certified the actual adjusted funding target attain- ment percentage of the plan for the current plan year, until the enrolled actuary so certifies, such first day shall be deemed, for purposes of such paragraph, to be the valu- ation date of the plan for the current plan year and the ad- justed funding target attainment percentage of the plan as of such first day shall, for purposes of such paragraph, be presumed to be equal to 10 percentage points less than the adjusted funding target attainment percentage of the plan
for such preceding plan year.

(9) TERMS RELATING TO FUNDING TARGET ATTAINMENT PER-
CENTAGE.—For purposes of this subsection—
(A) IN GENERAL.—The term ‘‘funding target attain-
ment percentage’’ has the same meaning given such term by section 303(d)(2).
(B) ADJUSTED FUNDING TARGET ATTAINMENT PERCENT- AGE.—The term ‘‘adjusted funding target attainment per- centage’’ means the funding target attainment percentage which is determined under subparagraph (A) by increasing each of the amounts under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 303(d)(2) by the aggregate amount of purchases of annuities for employees other than highly compensated employees (as defined in section 414(q) of the Internal Rev- enue Code of 1986) which were made by the plan during the preceding 2 plan years.
(C) APPLICATION TO PLANS WHICH ARE FULLY FUNDED WITHOUT REGARD TO REDUCTIONS FOR FUNDING BAL- ANCES.—In the case of a plan for any plan year, if the funding target attainment percentage is 100 percent or more (determined without regard to the reduction in the value of assets under section 303(f)(4)), the funding target attainment percentage for purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be determined without regard to such reduc- tion.
(10) SECRETARIAL AUTHORITY FOR PLANS WITH ALTERNATE VALUATION DATE.—In the case of a plan which has designated a valuation date other than the first day of the plan year, the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe rules for the applica- tion of this subsection which are necessary to reflect the alter- nate valuation date.
øParagraph (11) repealed by section 221(a)(57)(G)(ii) of division A of Public Law 113–295.¿
(12) CSEC PLANS.—This subsection shall not apply to a CSEC plan (as defined in section 210(f)).
(h) SPECIAL RULES APPLICABLE TO BENEFIT OVERPAYMENTS.—
(1) GENERAL RULE.—In the case of an inadvertent benefit overpayment by any pension plan, the responsible plan fidu- ciary shall not be considered to have failed to comply with the requirements of this title merely because such fiduciary deter- mines, in the exercise of its discretion, not to seek recovery of all or part of such overpayment from—
(A) any participant or beneficiary,
(B) any plan sponsor of, or contributing employer to—
(i) an individual account plan, provided that the amount needed to prevent or restore any impermis- sible forfeiture from any participant’s or beneficiary’s account arising in connection with the overpayment is, separately from and independently of the overpay- ment, allocated to such account pursuant to the non- forfeitability requirements of section 203 (for example, out of the plan’s forfeiture account, additional em-

ployer contributions, or recoveries from those respon- sible for the overpayment), or
(ii) a defined benefit pension plan subject to the funding rules in part 3 of this subtitle B, unless the responsible plan fiduciary determines, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, that failure to recover all or part of the overpayment faster than required under such funding rules would materially affect the plan’s ability to pay benefits due to other participants and beneficiaries, or
(C) any fiduciary of the plan, other than a fiduciary
(including a plan sponsor or contributing employer acting in a fiduciary capacity) whose breach of its fiduciary duties resulted in such overpayment, provided that if the plan has established prudent procedures to prevent and mini- mize overpayment of benefits and the relevant plan fidu- ciaries have followed such procedures, an inadvertent ben- efit overpayment will not give rise to a breach of fiduciary duty.
(2) REDUCTION IN FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND RECOV- ERY FROM RESPONSIBLE PARTY.—Paragraph (1) shall not fail to apply with respect to any inadvertent benefit overpayment merely because, after discovering such overpayment, the re- sponsible plan fiduciary—
(A) reduces future benefit payments to the correct amount provided for under the terms of the plan, or
(B) seeks recovery from the person or persons respon- sible for the overpayment.
(3) EMPLOYER FUNDING OBLIGATIONS.—Nothing in this sub-
section shall relieve an employer of any obligation imposed on it to make contributions to a plan to meet the minimum fund- ing standards under part 3 of this subtitle B or to prevent or restore an impermissible forfeiture in accordance with section 203.
(4) RECOUPMENT FROM PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES.— If the responsible plan fiduciary, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, decides to seek recoupment from a participant or beneficiary of all or part of an inadvertent benefit overpayment made by the plan to such participant or beneficiary, it may do so, subject to the following conditions:
(A) No interest or other additional amounts (such as collection costs or fees) are sought on overpaid amounts for any period.
(B) If the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a non-decreasing annuity by reducing future benefit pay- ments—
(i) the reduction ceases after the plan has recov- ered the full dollar amount of the overpayment,
(ii) the amount recouped each calendar year does not exceed 10 percent of the full dollar amount of the overpayment, and
(iii) future benefit payments are not reduced to below 90 percent of the periodic amount otherwise payable under the terms of the plan.

Alternatively, if the plan seeks to recoup past overpay- ments of a non-decreasing annuity through one or more in- stallment payments, the sum of such installment pay- ments in any calendar year does not exceed the sum of the reductions that would be permitted in such year under the preceding sentence.
(C) If the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a benefit other than a non-decreasing annuity, the plan satisfies requirements developed by the Secretary of Labor for purposes of this subparagraph.
(D) Efforts to recoup overpayments are—
(i) not accompanied by threats of litigation, unless
the responsible plan fiduciary makes a determination that there is a reasonable likelihood of success to re- cover an amount greater than the cost of recovery, and
(ii) not made through a collection agency or simi- lar third party, unless the participant or beneficiary ignores or rejects efforts to recoup the overpayment following either a final judgment in Federal or State court or a settlement between the participant or bene- ficiary and the plan, in either case authorizing such recoupment.
(E) Recoupment of past overpayments to a participant
is not sought from any beneficiary of the participant, in- cluding a spouse, surviving spouse, former spouse, or other beneficiary.
(F) Recoupment may not be sought if the first overpay- ment occurred more than 3 years before the participant or beneficiary is first notified in writing of the error, except in the case of fraud or misrepresentation by the partici- pant.
(G) A participant or beneficiary from whom recoupment is sought is entitled to contest all or part of the recoupment pursuant to the claims procedures of the plan that made the overpayment to the extent such proce- dures are consistent with section 503 of this title and in the case of an inadvertent benefit overpayment from a plan to which paragraph (1) applies that is transferred to an eligible retirement plan (as defined in section 402(c)(8)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) by or on behalf of a participant or beneficiary—
(i) such plan shall notify the plan receiving the rollover of such dispute,
(ii) the plan receiving the rollover shall retain such overpayment on behalf of the participant or bene- ficiary (and shall be entitled to treat such overpay- ment as plan assets) pending the outcome of such pro- cedures, and
(iii) the portion of such overpayment with respect to which recoupment is sought on behalf of the plan shall be permitted to be returned to such plan if it is determined to be an overpayment (and the plans mak- ing and receiving such transfer shall be treated as per- mitting such transfer).

(H) In determining the amount of recoupment to seek, the responsible plan fiduciary may take into account the hardship that recoupment likely would impose on the par- ticipant or beneficiary.
(5) EFFECT OF CULPABILITY.—Subparagraphs (A) through
 (F) of paragraph (4) shall not apply to protect a participant or beneficiary who is culpable. For purposes of this paragraph, a participant or beneficiary is culpable if the individual bears re- sponsibility for the overpayment (such as through misrepresen- tations or omissions that led to the overpayment), or if the in- dividual knew that the benefit payment or payments were ma- terially in excess of the correct amount. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an individual is not culpable merely be- cause the individual believed the benefit payment or payments were or might be in excess of the correct amount, if the indi- vidual raised that question with an authorized plan represent- ative and was told the payment or payments were not in ex- cess of the correct amount.

(b) For purposes of this part and part 3—
(1) in any case in which the employer maintains a plan of a predecessor employer, service for such predecessor shall be treated as service for the employer, and
(2) in any case in which the employer maintains a plan which is not the plan maintained by a predecessor employer, service for such predecessor shall, to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, be treated as service for the employer.
(c) For purposes of sections 202, 203, and 204, all corporations
which are members of a controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1563(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, determined without regard to section 1563(a)(4) and (e)(3)(C) of such Code) shall be treated as employed by a single employer.

For purposes of subparagraph (A) and section 307(c), any plan amendment made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement relating to the plan which amends the plan solely to conform to any requirement contained in this Act or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall not be treated as a termination of such collective bargaining agreement. This paragraph shall not apply unless the Secretary determines that the participation and vesting rules in ef- fect on the date of enactment of this Act øSeptember 2, 1974¿ are not less favorable to participants, in the aggregate, than the rules provided under sections 202, 203, and 204.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term ‘‘supplementary or special plan provision’’ means any plan provision which—
(A) provides supplementary benefits, not in excess of one- third of the basic benefit, in the form of an annuity for the life of the participant, or
(B) provides that, under a contractual agreement based on medical evidence as to the effects of working in an adverse en- vironment for an extended period of time, a participant having 25 years of service is to be treated as having 30 years of serv- ice.
(3) This subsection shall apply with respect to a plan if (and

plies and to all subsequent plan years.
(e)(1) No pension plan to which section 202 applies may make
effective any plan amendment with respect to breaks in service (which amendment is made or becomes effective after January 1, 1974, and before the date on which section 202 first becomes effec- tive with respect to such plan) which provides that any employee’s participation in the plan would commence at any date later than the later of—
(A) the date on which his participation would commence under the break in service rules of section 202(b), or
(B) the date on which his participation would commence under the plan as in effect on January 1, 1974.

fective any plan amendment with respect to breaks in service (which amendment is made or becomes effective after January 1, 1974, and before the date on which section 203 first becomes effec- tive with respect to such plan) if such amendment provides that the nonforfeitable benefit derived from employer contributions to which any employee would be entitled is less than the lesser of the nonforfeitable benefit derived from employer contributions to which he would be entitled under—
(A) the break in service rules of section 202(b)(3), or (B) the plan as in effect on January 1, 1974.

(B) does not reduce the accrued benefit of any partici- pant determined as of the beginning of the first plan year to which the amendment applies, and
(C) does not reduce the accrued benefit of any partici- pant determined as of the time of adoption except to the extent required by the circumstances,
shall, at the election of the plan administrator, be deemed to have been made on the first day of such plan year.

(1) FUNDING TARGET.—Except as provided in subsection (i)(1) with respect to plans in at-risk status, the funding target of a plan for a plan year is the present value of all benefits ac- crued or earned under the plan as of the beginning of the plan year.
(2) FUNDING TARGET ATTAINMENT PERCENTAGE.—The ‘‘funding target attainment percentage’’ of a plan for a plan year is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) which—
(A) the value of plan assets for the plan year (as re- duced under subsection (f)(4)(B)), bears to
(B) the funding target of the plan for the plan year (determined without regard to subsection (i)(1)).
(e) WAIVER AMORTIZATION CHARGE.—
(1) DETERMINATION OF WAIVER AMORTIZATION CHARGE.—
The waiver amortization charge (if any) for a plan for any plan year is the aggregate total of the waiver amortization install- ments for such plan year with respect to the waiver amortiza- tion bases for each of the 5 preceding plan years.
(2) WAIVER AMORTIZATION INSTALLMENT.—For purposes of paragraph (1)—
(A) DETERMINATION.—The waiver amortization install- ments are the amounts necessary to amortize the waiver amortization base of the plan for any plan year in level an- nual installments over a period of 5 plan years beginning with the succeeding plan year.
(B) WAIVER INSTALLMENT.—The waiver amortization installment for any plan year in the 5-year period under subparagraph (A) with respect to any waiver amortization base is the annual installment determined under subpara- graph (A) for that year for that base.
(3) INTEREST RATE.—In determining any waiver amortiza- tion installment under this subsection, the plan sponsor shall use the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C) of subsection (h)(2), applied under rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (B) of subsection (h)(2).
(4) WAIVER AMORTIZATION BASE.—The waiver amortization base of a plan for a plan year is the amount of the waived funding deficiency (if any) for such plan year under section 302(c).
(5) EARLY DEEMED AMORTIZATION UPON ATTAINMENT OF FUNDING TARGET.—In any case in which the funding shortfall of a plan for a plan year is zero, for purposes of determining the waiver amortization charge for such plan year and suc- ceeding plan years, the waiver amortization bases for all pre- ceding plan years (and all waiver amortization installments de- termined with respect to such bases) shall be reduced to zero.

(ii) ADJUSTMENTS FOR INTEREST.—Any excess con- tributions under clause (i) shall be properly adjusted for interest accruing for the periods between the first day of the current plan year and the dates on which the excess contributions were made, determined by using the effective interest rate for the preceding plan year and by treating contributions as being first used to satisfy the minimum required contribution.
(iii) CERTAIN CONTRIBUTIONS NECESSARY TO AVOID BENEFIT LIMITATIONS DISREGARDED.—The excess de- scribed in clause (i) with respect to any preceding plan year shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of contributions an employer would be re- quired to make under paragraph (1), (2), or (4) of sec- tion 206(g) to avoid a benefit limitation which would otherwise be imposed under such paragraph for the preceding plan year. Any contribution which may be taken into account in satisfying the requirements of more than 1 of such paragraphs shall be taken into ac- count only once for purposes of this clause.
(C) DECREASE.—The prefunding balance of a plan
shall be decreased (but not below zero) by—
(i) as of the first day of each plan year after 2008,
the amount of such balance credited under paragraph (2) (if any) in reducing the minimum required con- tribution of the plan for the preceding plan year, and
(ii) as of the time specified in paragraph (5)(A), any reduction in such balance elected under para- graph (5).
(7) FUNDING STANDARD CARRYOVER BALANCE.—

as provided in paragraph (8).
(B) BEGINNING BALANCE.—The beginning balance of
the funding standard carryover balance shall be the posi- tive balance described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii)(II).
(C) DECREASES.—The funding standard carryover bal- ance of a plan shall be decreased (but not below zero) by— (i) as of the first day of each plan year after 2008, the amount of such balance credited under paragraph (2) (if any) in reducing the minimum required con- tribution of the plan for the preceding plan year, and (ii) as of the time specified in paragraph (5)(A), any reduction in such balance elected under para-
graph (5).
(8) ADJUSTMENTS FOR INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE.—In deter-
mining the prefunding balance or the funding standard carry- over balance of a plan as of the first day of the plan year, the plan sponsor shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, adjust such balance to reflect the rate of return on plan assets for the preceding plan year. Notwithstanding subsection (g)(3), such rate of return shall be

(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the valuation date of a plan for any plan year shall be
the first day of the plan year.
(B) EXCEPTION FOR SMALL PLANS.—If, on each day dur-
ing the preceding plan year, a plan had 100 or fewer par- ticipants, the plan may designate any day during the plan year as its valuation date for such plan year and suc- ceeding plan years. For purposes of this subparagraph, all defined benefit plans which are single-employer plans and are maintained by the same employer (or any member of such employer’s controlled group) shall be treated as 1 plan, but only participants with respect to such employer or member shall be taken into account.
(C) APPLICATION OF CERTAIN RULES IN DETERMINATION OF PLAN SIZE.—For purposes of this paragraph—
(i) PLANS NOT IN EXISTENCE IN PRECEDING YEAR.— In the case of the first plan year of any plan, subpara- graph (B) shall apply to such plan by taking into ac- count the number of participants that the plan is rea- sonably expected to have on days during such first plan year.
(ii) PREDECESSORS.—Any reference in subpara- graph (B) to an employer shall include a reference to any predecessor of such employer.
(3) DETERMINATION OF VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS.—For pur- poses of this section—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the value of plan assets shall be the fair market value of the assets.
(B) AVERAGING ALLOWED.—A plan may determine the value of plan assets on the basis of the averaging of fair market values, but only if such method—
(i) is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury,
(ii) does not provide for averaging of such values over more than the period beginning on the last day of the 25th month preceding the month in which the valuation date occurs and ending on the valuation date (or a similar period in the case of a valuation date which is not the 1st day of a month), and

(iii) does not result in a determination of the value of plan assets which, at any time, is lower than 90 percent or greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of such assets at such time.
Any such averaging shall be adjusted for contributions, distributions, and expected earnings (as determined by the plan’s actuary on the basis of an assumed earnings rate specified by the actuary but not in excess of the third seg- ment rate applicable under subsection (h)(2)(C)(iii)), as specified by the Secretary of the Treasury.
(4) ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRIBUTION RECEIPTS.—For pur- poses of determining the value of assets under paragraph (3)—
(A) PRIOR YEAR CONTRIBUTIONS.—If—
(i) an employer makes any contribution to the
plan after the valuation date for the plan year in which the contribution is made, and
(ii) the contribution is for a preceding plan year, the contribution shall be taken into account as an asset of the plan as of the valuation date, except that in the case of any plan year beginning after 2008, only the present value (determined as of the valuation date) of such con- tribution may be taken into account. For purposes of the preceding sentence, present value shall be determined using the effective interest rate for the preceding plan year to which the contribution is properly allocable.
(B) SPECIAL RULE FOR CURRENT YEAR CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BEFORE VALUATION DATE.—If any contributions for any plan year are made to or under the plan during the plan year but before the valuation date for the plan year, the assets of the plan as of the valuation date shall not in- clude—
(i) such contributions, and
(ii) interest on such contributions for the period between the date of the contributions and the valu- ation date, determined by using the effective interest rate for the plan year.
(h) ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to this subsection, the deter-
mination of any present value or other computation under this section shall be made on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods—
(A) each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations), and
(B) which, in combination, offer the actuary’s best esti- mate of anticipated experience under the plan.
(2) INTEREST RATES.—
(A) EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE.—For purposes of this section, the term ‘‘effective interest rate’’ means, with re- spect to any plan for any plan year, the single rate of in- terest which, if used to determine the present value of the plan’s accrued or earned benefits referred to in subsection (d)(1), would result in an amount equal to the funding tar- get of the plan for such plan year.

(5) APPROVAL OF LARGE CHANGES IN ACTUARIAL ASSUMP-
TIONS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—No actuarial assumption used to de-

(ii) All employees shall be assumed to elect the re- tirement benefit available under the plan at the as- sumed retirement age (determined after application of clause (i)) which would result in the highest present value of benefits.
(C) LOADING FACTOR.—The loading factor applied with respect to a plan under this paragraph for any plan year is the sum of—
(i) $700, times the number of participants in the plan, plus
(ii) 4 percent of the funding target (determined without regard to this paragraph) of the plan for the plan year.

(A) WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY.—Any amount received by a multiemployer plan in payment of all or part of an em- ployer’s withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of title IV shall be considered an amount contributed by the employer to or under the plan. The Secretary of the Treas- ury may prescribe by regulation additional charges and credits to a multiemployer plan’s funding standard account to the extent necessary to prevent withdrawal liability payments from being unduly reflected as advance funding for plan liabilities.
(B) ADJUSTMENTS WHEN A MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN LEAVES REORGANIZATION.—If a multiemployer plan is not in reorganization in the plan year but was in reorganiza- tion in the immediately preceding plan year, any balance in the funding standard account at the close of such imme- diately preceding plan year—

(ii) shall be taken into account in subsequent plan years by being amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 30 plan years.
The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent of any accumulated funding deficiency under section 4243(a) as of the end of the last plan year that the plan was in reorga- nization.
(C) PLAN PAYMENTS TO SUPPLEMENTAL PROGRAM OR WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY PAYMENT FUND.—Any amount paid by a plan during a plan year to the Pension Benefit Guar- anty Corporation pursuant to section 4222 of this Act or to a fund exempt under section 501(c)(22) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 pursuant to section 4223 of this Act shall reduce the amount of contributions considered re- ceived by the plan for the plan year.
(D) INTERIM WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY PAYMENTS.—Any amount paid by an employer pending a final determination of the employer’s withdrawal liability under part 1 of sub- title E of title IV and subsequently refunded to the em- ployer by the plan shall be charged to the funding stand- ard account in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
(E) ELECTION FOR DEFERRAL OF CHARGE FOR PORTION OF NET EXPERIENCE LOSS.—If an election is in effect under section 302(b)(7)(F) (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006) for any plan year, the funding standard account shall be charged in the plan year to which the portion of the net experience loss deferred by such election was deferred with

the amount so deferred (and paragraph (2)(B)(iii) shall not apply to the amount so charged).

(G) SHORT-TERM BENEFITS.—To the extent that any plan amendment increases the unfunded past service li- ability under the plan by reason of an increase in benefits which are not payable as a life annuity but are payable under the terms of the plan for a period that does not ex- ceed 14 years from the effective date of the amendment, paragraph (2)(B)(ii) shall be applied separately with re- spect to such increase in unfunded past service liability by substituting the number of years of the period during which such benefits are payable for ‘‘15’’.
(8) SPECIAL RELIEF RULES.—Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection—
(A) AMORTIZATION OF NET INVESTMENT LOSSES.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—A multiemployer plan with re- spect to which the solvency test under subparagraph (C) is met may treat the portion of any experience loss or gain attributable to net investment losses incurred in either or both of the first two plan years ending after August 31, 2008, as an item separate from other experi- ence losses, to be amortized in equal annual install-
ments (until fully amortized) over the period —
(I) beginning with the plan year in which such portion is first recognized in the actuarial value of
assets, and
(II) ending with the last plan year in the 30-
plan year period beginning with the plan year in which such net investment loss was incurred.
(ii) COORDINATION WITH EXTENSIONS.—If this sub-
paragraph applies for any plan year—
(I) no extension of the amortization period
under clause (i) shall be allowed under subsection (d), and
(II) if an extension was granted under sub- section (d) for any plan year before the election to have this subparagraph apply to the plan year, such extension shall not result in such amortiza- tion period exceeding 30 years.
(iii) NET INVESTMENT LOSSES.—For purposes of
this subparagraph—
(I) IN GENERAL.—Net investment losses shall
be determined in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of the dif- ference between actual and expected returns (in- cluding any difference attributable to any crimi- nally fraudulent investment arrangement).

(i) IN GENERAL.—A multiemployer plan with re-
spect to which the solvency test under subparagraph (C) is met may change its asset valuation method in a manner which—

(II) provides that for either or both of the first 2 plan years beginning after August 31, 2008, the value of plan assets at any time shall not be less than 80 percent or greater than 130 percent of the fair market value of such assets at such time, or
(III) makes both changes described in sub- clauses (I) and (II) to such method.
(ii) ASSET VALUATION METHODS.—If this subpara-
graph applies for any plan year—
(I) the Secretary of the Treasury shall not treat
the asset valuation method of the plan as unrea- sonable solely because of the changes in such meth- od described in clause (i), and
(II) such changes shall be deemed approved by such Secretary under section 302(d)(1) and section 412(d)(1) of such Code.
(iii) AMORTIZATION OF REDUCTION IN UNFUNDED
ACCRUED LIABILITY.—If this subparagraph and sub- paragraph (A) both apply for any plan year, the plan shall treat any reduction in unfunded accrued liability resulting from the application of this subparagraph as a separate experience amortization base, to be amor- tized in equal annual installments (until fully amor- tized) over a period of 30 plan years rather than the pe- riod such liability would otherwise be amortized over. (C) SOLVENCY TEST.—The solvency test under this
paragraph is met only if the plan actuary certifies that the plan is projected to have sufficient assets to timely pay ex- pected benefits and anticipated expenditures over the amor- tization period, taking into account the changes in the funding standard account under this paragraph.
(D) RESTRICTION ON BENEFIT INCREASES.—If subpara- graph (A) or (B) apply to a multiemployer plan for any plan year, then, in addition to any other applicable restric- tions on benefit increases, a plan amendment increasing benefits may not go into effect during either of the 2 plan years immediately following such plan year unless—

actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience.
(E) REQUIRED CHANGE OF INTEREST RATE.—For pur-
poses of determining a plan’s current liability for purposes of this paragraph—
(i) IN GENERAL.—If any rate of interest used under the plan under subsection (b)(6) to determine cost is not within the permissible range, the plan shall estab- lish a new rate of interest within the permissible range.
(ii) PERMISSIBLE RANGE.—For purposes of this sub- paragraph—
(I) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in sub- clause (II), the term ‘‘permissible range’’ means a rate of interest which is not more than 5 percent above, and not more than 10 percent below, the weighted average of the rates of interest on 30- year Treasury securities during the 4-year period ending on the last day before the beginning of the plan year.
(II) SECRETARIAL AUTHORITY.—If the Sec- retary of the Treasury finds that the lowest rate of interest permissible under subclause (I) is un- reasonably high, such Secretary may prescribe a lower rate of interest, except that such rate may not be less than 80 percent of the average rate de- termined under such subclause.
(iii) ASSUMPTIONS.—Notwithstanding paragraph
(3)(A), the interest rate used under the plan shall be— (I) determined without taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expecta-
tions, but
(II) consistent with the assumptions which re-
flect the purchase rates which would be used by insurance companies to satisfy the liabilities under the plan.
(7) ANNUAL VALUATION.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of this section, a deter-
mination of experience gains and losses and a valuation of the plan’s liability shall be made not less frequently than once every year, except that such determination shall be made more frequently to the extent required in particular cases under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
(B) VALUATION DATE.—
(i) CURRENT YEAR.—Except as provided in clause
(ii), the valuation referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be made as of a date within the plan year to which the valuation refers or within one month prior to the be- ginning of such year.
(ii) USE OF PRIOR YEAR VALUATION.—The valuation referred to in subparagraph (A) may be made as of a date within the plan year prior to the year to which the valuation refers if, as of such date, the value of the

assets of the plan are not less than 100 percent of the plan’s current liability (as defined in paragraph (6)(D) without regard to clause (iv) thereof).
(iii) ADJUSTMENTS.—Information under clause (ii) shall, in accordance with regulations, be actuarially adjusted to reflect significant differences in partici- pants.
(iv) LIMITATION.—A change in funding method to use a prior year valuation, as provided in clause (ii), may not be made unless as of the valuation date with- in the prior plan year, the value of the assets of the plan are not less than 125 percent of the plan’s cur- rent liability (as defined in paragraph (6)(D) without regard to clause (iv) thereof).
(8) TIME WHEN CERTAIN CONTRIBUTIONS DEEMED MADE.— For purposes of this section, any contributions for a plan year made by an employer after the last day of such plan year, but not later than two and one-half months after such day, shall be deemed to have been made on such last day. For purposes of this subparagraph, such two and one-half month period may be extended for not more than six months under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
(d) EXTENSION OF AMORTIZATION PERIODS FOR MULTIEMPLOYER
PLANS.—
(1) AUTOMATIC EXTENSION UPON APPLICATION BY CERTAIN
PLANS.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—If the plan sponsor of a multiem-
ployer plan—
(i) submits to the Secretary of the Treasury an ap-
plication for an extension of the period of years re- quired to amortize any unfunded liability described in any clause of subsection (b)(2)(B) or described in sub- section (b)(4), and
(ii) includes with the application a certification by the plan’s actuary described in subparagraph (B),
the Secretary of the Treasury shall extend the amortiza- tion period for the period of time (not in excess of 5 years) specified in the application. Such extension shall be in ad- dition to any extension under paragraph (2).
(B) CRITERIA.—A certification with respect to a multi- employer plan is described in this subparagraph if the plan’s actuary certifies that, based on reasonable assump- tions—
(i) absent the extension under subparagraph (A), the plan would have an accumulated funding defi- ciency in the current plan year or any of the 9 suc- ceeding plan years,
(ii) the plan sponsor has adopted a plan to im- prove the plan’s funding status,
(iii) the plan is projected to have sufficient assets to timely pay expected benefits and anticipated ex- penditures over the amortization period as extended, and

(iv) the notice required under paragraph (3)(A) has been provided.
(2) ALTERNATIVE EXTENSION.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—If the plan sponsor of a multiem-
ployer plan submits to the Secretary of the Treasury an application for an extension of the period of years required to amortize any unfunded liability described in any clause of subsection (b)(2)(B) or described in subsection (b)(4), the Secretary of the Treasury may extend the amortization pe- riod for a period of time (not in excess of 10 years reduced by the number of years of any extension under paragraph (1) with respect to such unfunded liability) if the Secretary of the Treasury makes the determination described in sub- paragraph (B). Such extension shall be in addition to any extension under paragraph (1).
(B) DETERMINATION.—The Secretary of the Treasury may grant an extension under subparagraph (A) if such Secretary determines that—
(i) such extension would carry out the purposes of this Act and would provide adequate protection for participants under the plan and their beneficiaries, and
(ii) the failure to permit such extension would— (I) result in a substantial risk to the vol- untary continuation of the plan, or a substantial curtailment of pension benefit levels or employee
compensation, and
(II) be adverse to the interests of plan partici-
pants in the aggregate.
(C) ACTION BY SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.—The Sec-
retary of the Treasury shall act upon any application for an extension under this paragraph within 180 days of the submission of such application. If such Secretary rejects the application for an extension under this paragraph, such Secretary shall provide notice to the plan detailing the specific reasons for the rejection, including references to the criteria set forth above.
(3) ADVANCE NOTICE.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall,
before granting an extension under this subsection, require each applicant to provide evidence satisfactory to such Sec- retary that the applicant has provided notice of the filing of the application for such extension to each affected party (as defined in section 4001(a)(21)) with respect to the af- fected plan. Such notice shall include a description of the extent to which the plan is funded for benefits which are guaranteed under title IV and for benefit liabilities.
(B) CONSIDERATION OF RELEVANT INFORMATION.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall consider any relevant in- formation provided by a person to whom notice was given under paragraph (1).

(B) ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS OF ASSETS AND LIABIL- ITIES.—
(i) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in clause (iv), in making the determinations and projections under this subsection, the plan actuary shall make projec- tions required for the current and succeeding plan years of the current value of the assets of the plan and the present value of all liabilities to participants and beneficiaries under the plan for the current plan year as of the beginning of such year. The actuary’s projec- tions shall be based on reasonable actuarial estimates, assumptions, and methods that, except as provided in clause (iii), offer the actuary’s best estimate of antici- pated experience under the plan. The projected present value of liabilities as of the beginning of such year shall be determined based on the most recent of either—
(I) the actuarial statement required under section 103(d) with respect to the most recently filed annual report, or
(II) the actuarial valuation for the preceding plan year.
(ii) DETERMINATIONS OF FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS.— Any actuarial projection of plan assets shall assume— (I) reasonably anticipated employer contribu- tions for the current and succeeding plan years, assuming that the terms of the one or more collec- tive bargaining agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained for the current plan year con-
tinue in effect for succeeding plan years, or

(II) the plan actuary shall take into account any suspensions of benefits described in sub- section (e)(9) adopted in a prior plan year that are still in effect.
(C) PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO SECURE TIMELY ACTU- ARIAL CERTIFICATION.—Any failure of the plan’s actuary to certify the plan’s status under this subsection by the date specified in subparagraph (A) shall be treated for purposes of section 502(c)(2) as a failure or refusal by the plan ad- ministrator to file the annual report required to be filed with the Secretary under section 101(b)(1).

(II) 33 percent of the difference between 100 percent and the percentage under subclause (I). (ii) AVOIDANCE OF ACCUMULATED FUNDING DEFI-
CIENCIES.—No accumulated funding deficiency for the last plan year during the funding improvement period (taking into account any extension of amortization pe- riods under section 304(d)).
(B) SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED PLANS.—In the case of a plan in seriously endangered status, except as provided in
61 So in law. The reference to ‘‘paragraph (b)(3)’’ probably should read ‘‘paragraph (3) of sub- section (b)’’ or ‘‘subsection (b)(3)’’.

to the multiemployer plan that provides for—
(i) a reduction in the level of contributions for any
participants,
(ii) a suspension of contributions with respect to
any period of service, or
(iii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of young-
er or newly hired employees from plan participation, and
(B) no amendment of the plan which increases the li-
abilities of the plan by reason of any increase in benefits, any change in the accrual of benefits, or any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan may be adopted unless the amendment is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or to com- ply with other applicable law.
(e) REHABILITATION PLAN MUST BE ADOPTED FOR MULTIEM- PLOYER PLANS IN CRITICAL STATUS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—In any case in which a multiemployer plan is in critical status for a plan year, the plan sponsor, in accordance with this subsection—
(A) shall adopt a rehabilitation plan not later than 240 days following the required date for the actuarial certifi- cation of critical status under subsection (b)(3)(A), and
(B) within 30 days after the adoption of the rehabilita- tion plan—
(i) shall provide to the bargaining parties 1 or more schedules showing revised benefit structures, re- vised contribution structures, or both, which, if adopt- ed, may reasonably be expected to enable the multiem- ployer plan to emerge from critical status in accord- ance with the rehabilitation plan, and
(ii) may, if the plan sponsor deems appropriate, prepare and provide the bargaining parties with addi- tional information relating to contribution rates or benefit reductions, alternative schedules, or other in- formation relevant to emerging from critical status in accordance with the rehabilitation plan.
The schedule or schedules described in subparagraph (B)(i) shall reflect reductions in future benefit accruals and adjust- able benefits, and increases in contributions, that the plan sponsor determines are reasonably necessary to emerge from critical status. One schedule shall be designated as the default schedule and such schedule shall assume that there are no in- creases in contributions under the plan other than the in- creases necessary to emerge from critical status after future benefit accruals and other benefits (other than benefits the re- duction or elimination of which are not permitted under section 204(g)) have been reduced to the maximum extent permitted by law.

A rehabilitation plan must provide annual standards for meeting the requirements of such rehabilitation plan. Such plan shall also include the schedules required to be pro- vided under paragraph (1)(B)(i) and if clause (ii) applies, shall set forth the alternatives considered, explain why the plan is not reasonably expected to emerge from critical sta- tus by the end of the rehabilitation period, and specify when, if ever, the plan is expected to emerge from critical status in accordance with the rehabilitation plan.

(B) if lower, the accrual rate under the plan on such first day.
The equivalent standard accrual rate shall be determined by the plan sponsor based on the standard or average contribution base units which the plan sponsor determines to be representa- tive for active participants and such other factors as the plan sponsor determines to be relevant. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as limiting the ability of the plan sponsor to prepare and provide the bargaining parties with alternative schedules to the default schedule that establish lower or higher accrual and contribution rates than the rates otherwise de- scribed in this paragraph.

(I) Current and past contribution levels.

(VII) Competitive and other economic factors facing contributing employers.
(VIII) The impact of benefit and contribution levels on retaining active participants and bar- gaining groups under the plan.

This paragraph shall not apply to any plan amendment that is required to comply with any applicable law. This paragraph shall cease to apply with respect to any plan year, effective as of the first day of the plan year (or if later, the effective date of the amendment) upon payment by the plan sponsor of a contribution to the plan (in addition to any contribution required under this section without regard to this paragraph) in an amount equal to the increase in the funding liability of the plan attributable to the plan amendment.

The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this paragraph.
(3) An election under this paragraph may not be made after December 31, 1975. Such an election shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, and shall be irrev- ocable.

(d) For purposes of this section—
(1) The term ‘‘employer security’’ means a security issued

(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a plan shall be treated as an eligible individual account plan with respect to the acquisition or holding of qualifying employer real property or qualifying employer securities only if such plan explicitly provides for acquisition and holding of qualifying employer se- curities or qualifying employer real property (as the case may be). In the case of a plan in existence on the date of enactment of this Act øSeptember 2, 1974¿, this subparagraph shall not take effect until January 1, 1976.
(C) The term ‘‘eligible individual account plan’’ does not in- clude any individual account plan the benefits of which are taken into account in determining the benefits payable to a participant under any defined benefit plan.

(C) even if all of such real property is leased to one lessee (which may be an employer, or an affiliate of an em- ployer); and
(D) if the acquisition and retention of such property comply with the provisions of this part (other than section 404(a)(1)(B) to the extent it requires diversification, and sections 404(a)(1)(C), 406, and subsection (a) of this sec- tion).

After December 17, 1987, in the case of a plan other than an eligible individual account plan, an employer security described in subparagraph (A) or (C) shall be considered a qualifying em- ployer security only if such employer security satisfies the re- quirements of subsection (f)(1).
(6) The term ‘‘employee stock ownership plan’’ means an individual account plan—
(A) which is a stock bonus plan which is qualified, or a stock bonus plan and money purchase plan both of which are qualified, under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and which is designed to invest primarily in qualifying employer securities, and
(B) which meets such other requirements as the Sec- retary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulation.
(7) A corporation is an affiliate of an employer if it is a
member of any controlled group of corporations (as defined in section 1563(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, except that ‘‘applicable percentage’’ shall be substituted for ‘‘80 per- cent’’ wherever the latter percentage appears in such section) of which the employer who maintains the plan is a member. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term ‘‘applicable percentage’’ means 50 percent, or such lower percentage as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation. A person other than a corporation shall be treated as an affiliate of an employer to the extent provided in regulations of the Secretary. An em- ployer which is a person other than a corporation shall be treated as affiliated with another person to the extent provided by regulations of the Secretary. Regulations under this para- graph shall be prescribed only after consultation and coordina- tion with the Secretary of the Treasury.

Action under this subsection may be taken only after consultation and coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury.

(A) may employ reasonable procedures to limit the fre- quency or amount of matching contributions with respect to contributions to such account, solely to the extent nec- essary to prevent manipulation of the rules of the plan to cause matching contributions to exceed the intended amounts or frequency; and

(d) The Secretary of Labor and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, before filing briefs in any case involving the construc- tion or application of minimum participation standards, minimum vesting standards, or minimum funding standards under title I of this Act, shall afford the Secretary of the Treasury a reasonable op- portunity to review any such brief. The Secretary of the Treasury shall have the right to intervene in any such case.
(e) The Secretary of the Treasury shall consult with the Pen- sion Benefit Guaranty Corporation with respect to any proposed or final regulation authorized by subpart C of part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or by sections 4241 through 4245 of this Act, before publishing any such proposed or final regulation.

(b) In order to avoid unnecessary expense and duplication of functions among Government agencies, the Secretary of the Treas- ury and the Secretary of Labor may make such arrangements or agreements for cooperation or mutual assistance in the perform- ance of their functions under this Act, and the functions of any such agencies as they find to be practicable and consistent with law.

on the first plan year commencing after the date of enactment of this Act øSeptember 2, 1974¿ are due within 30 days after such plan year commences. Premiums shall continue to accrue until a plan’s assets are distributed pursuant to a termination procedure, or until a trustee is appointed pursuant to section 4042, whichever is earlier. The corporation may waive or reduce premiums for a multiemployer plan for any plan year during which such plan re- ceives financial assistance from the corporation under section 4261, except that any amount so waived or reduced shall be treated as financial assistance under such section.
(b)(1) If any basic benefit premium is not paid when it is due the corporation is authorized to assess a late payment charge of not more than 100 percent of the premium payment which was not timely paid. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any payment of premium made within 60 days after the date on which payment is due, if before such date, the designated payor obtains a waiver from the corporation based upon a showing of substantial hardship arising from the timely payment of the premium. The corporation is authorized to grant a waiver under this subsection upon applica- tion made by the designated payor, but the corporation may not grant a waiver if it appears that the designated payor will be un- able to pay the premium within 60 days after the date on which it is due. If any premium is not paid by the last date prescribed for a payment, interest on the amount of such premium at the rate imposed under section 6601(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to interest on underpayment, nonpayment, or exten- sions of time for payment of tax) shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date paid.
(2) The corporation is authorized to pay, subject to regulations prescribed by the corporation, interest on the amount of any over- payment of premium refunded to a designated payor. Interest under this paragraph shall be calculated at the same rate and in the same manner as interest is calculated for underpayments under paragraph (1).
(c) If any designated payor fails to pay a premium when due, the corporation is authorized to bring a civil action in any district court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which the plan assets are located, the plan is administered, or in which a defend- ant resides or is found for the recovery of the amount of the pre- mium penalty, and interest, and process may be served in any other district. The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction over actions brought under this subsection by the cor- poration without regard to the amount in controversy.
(d) The corporation shall not cease to guarantee basic benefits on account of the failure of a designated payor to pay any premium when due.
(e)(1) For purposes of this section, the term ‘‘designated payor’’ means—
(A) the contributing sponsor or plan administrator in the case of a single-employer plan, and
(B) the plan administrator in the case of a multiemployer plan.

(1) is an employee pension benefit plan (as defined in para- graph (2) of section 3 of this Act) established or maintained— (A) by an employer engaged in commerce or in any in-
dustry or activity affecting commerce, or
(B) by any employee organization, or organization rep-
resenting employees, engaged in commerce or in any in- dustry or activity affecting commerce, or
(C) by both,
which has, in practice, met the requirements of part I of sub- chapter D of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as in effect for the preceding 5 plan years of the plan) applica- ble to plans described in paragraph (2) for the preceding 5 plan years; or

For purposes of this title, a successor plan is considered to be a continuation of a predecessor plan. For this purpose, unless other- wise specifically indicated in this title, a successor plan is a plan which covers a group of employees which includes substantially the same employees as a previously established plan, and provides sub- stantially the same benefits as that plan provided.

(1) which is an individual account plan, as defined in para-
graph (34) of section 3 of this Act,

count plan’’ does not include a plan under which a fixed benefit is promised if the employer or his representative participated in the determination of that benefit.
(2) For purposes of this paragraph and for purposes of sub- section (b)(13)—
(A) the term ‘‘professional service employer’’ means any proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or other association or organization (i) owned or controlled by professional individuals or by executors or administrators of professional individuals, (ii) the principal business of which is the performance of pro- fessional services, and

(3) In the case of a plan established and maintained by more

(d) For purposes of subsection (b)(9), the term ‘‘substantial owner’’ means an individual who, at any time during the 60-month period ending on the date the determination is being made—

(3) in the case of a corporation, owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent in value of either the voting stock of that corporation or all the stock of that corporation.
For purposes of paragraph (3), the constructive ownership rules of section 1563(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (other than paragraph (3)(C) thereof) shall apply, including the application of such rules under section 414(c) of such Code.

(2) For purposes of this subsection, the time a successor plan
(within the meaning of section 4021(a)) has been in effect includes the time a previously established plan (within the meaning of sec- tion 4021(a)) was in effect. For purposes of determining what bene- fits are guaranteed under this section in the case of a plan to which section 4021 does not apply on the day after the date of enactment of this Act øthe day after September 2, 1974¿, the 60-month period referred to in paragraph (1) shall be computed beginning on the first date on which such section does apply to the plan.
(3) The amount of monthly benefits described in subsection (a) provided by a plan, which are guaranteed under this section with respect to a participant, shall not have an actuarial value which ex- ceeds the actuarial value of a monthly benefit in the form of a life annuity commencing at age 65 equal to the lesser of—
(A) his average monthly gross income from his employer during the 5 consecutive calendar year period (or, if less, dur- ing the number of calendar years in such period in which he actively participates in the plan) during which his gross income from that employer was greater than during any other such pe- riod with that employer determined by dividing 1⁄12 of the sum of all such gross income by the number of such calendar years in which he had such gross income, or
(B) $750 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the contribution and benefit base (determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act ø(42 U.S.C. 430)¿) in effect at the time the plan terminates and the denominator of which is such contribution and benefit base in effect in the calendar year 1974.
The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to non-basic benefits. The maximum guaranteed monthly benefit shall not be reduced solely on account of the age of a participant in the case of a benefit payable by reason of disability that occurred on or before the termi- nation date, if the participant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the corporation that the Social Security Administration has deter- mined that the participant satisfies the definition of disability under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act, and the regulations thereunder. If a benefit payable by reason of disability is converted to an early or normal retirement benefit for reasons other than a change in the health of the participant, such early or normal retire- ment benefit shall be treated as a continuation of the benefit pay- able by reason of disability and this subparagraph shall continue to apply.

(iii) any non-basic benefit shall be disregarded.
(5)(A) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘‘majority owner’’ means an individual who, at any time during the 60-month
period ending on the date the determination is being made—
(i) owns the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or
business,
(ii) in the case of a partnership, is a partner who owns, di-
rectly or indirectly, 50 percent or more of either the capital in- terest or the profits interest in such partnership, or
(iii) in the case of a corporation, owns, directly or indi- rectly, 50 percent or more in value of either the voting stock of that corporation or all the stock of that corporation.
For purposes of clause (iii), the constructive ownership rules of sec- tion 1563(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (other than para- graph (3)(C) thereof) shall apply, including the application of such rules under section 414(c) of such Code.
(B) In the case of a participant who is a majority owner, the amount of benefits guaranteed under this section shall equal the product of—
(i) a fraction (not to exceed 1) the numerator of which is the number of years from the later of the effective date or the adoption date of the plan to the termination date, and the de- nominator of which is 10, and
(ii) the amount of benefits that would be guaranteed under this section if the participant were not a majority owner.
(6)(A) No benefits accrued under a plan after the date on which
the Secretary of the Treasury issues notice that he has determined that any trust which is a part of a plan does not meet the require- ments of section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or that the plan does not meet the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of such Code, are guaranteed under this section unless such deter- mination is erroneous. This subparagraph does not apply if the Sec- retary subsequently issues a notice that such trust meets the re- quirements of section 401(a) of such Code or that the plan meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of such Code and if the Sec- retary determines that the trust or plan has taken action necessary to meet such requirements during the period between the issuance of the notice referred to in the preceding sentence and the issuance of the notice referred to in this sentence.
(B) No benefits accrued under a plan after the date on which an amendment of the plan is adopted which causes the Secretary of the Treasury to determine that any trust under the plan has ceased to meet the requirements of section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or that the plan has ceased to meet the re- quirements of section 404(a)(2) of such Code, are guaranteed under this section unless such determination is erroneous.

In deter- mining how many years a plan or amendment has been in effect for purposes of this paragraph, the first 12 months beginning with the date on which the plan or amendment is made or first becomes effective (whichever is later) constitutes one year, and each con- secutive period of 12 months thereafter constitutes an additional year. This paragraph does not apply to benefits payable under a plan unless the corporation finds substantial evidence that the plan was terminated for a reasonable business purpose and not for the purpose of obtaining the payment of benefits by the corporation under this title.

sions of this section with respect to a terminated plan, the corpora- tion shall pay the portion of the amount determined under para- graph (2) which is allocated with respect to each participant under section 4044(a). Such payment shall be made to such participant or to such participant’s beneficiaries (including alternate payees, with- in the meaning of section 206(d)(3)(K)).

(iii) CASES WITHOUT ANY FINDING OF SUFFI- CIENCY.—In any case in which the corporation deter- mines that it is unable to determine that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits on the basis of the information made available to it, the corporation shall commence proceedings in accordance with section 4042.
(C) FINDING AFTER AUTHORIZED COMMENCEMENT OF TERMINATION THAT PLAN IS UNABLE TO PAY BENEFITS.—
(i) FINDING WITH RESPECT TO BENEFIT LIABILITIES WHICH ARE NOT GUARANTEED BENEFITS.—If, after the plan administrator has begun to terminate the plan as authorized under subparagraph (B)(i), the plan admin- istrator finds that the plan is unable, or will be un- able, to pay benefit liabilities which are not benefits guaranteed by the corporation under section 4022, the plan administrator shall notify the corporation of such finding as soon as practicable thereafter.
(ii) FINDING WITH RESPECT TO GUARANTEED BENE- FITS.—If, after the plan administrator has begun to terminate the plan as authorized by subparagraph (B) (i) or (ii), the plan administrator finds that the plan is unable, or will be unable, to pay all benefits under the plan which are guaranteed by the corporation under section 4022, the plan administrator shall notify the corporation of such finding as soon as practicable thereafter.

(II) pays benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, only in the form of an annuity,
(III) does not use plan assets to purchase ir- revocable commitments to provide benefits from an insurer, and
(IV) continues to pay all benefit liabilities under the plan, but, commencing on the proposed termination date, limits the payment of benefits under the plan to those benefits which are guar- anteed by the corporation under section 4022 or to which assets are required to be allocated under section 4044.
 In the event the plan administrator is later determined not to have met the requirements for distress termination, any benefits which are not paid solely by reason of compli- ance with subclause (IV) shall be due and payable imme- diately (together with interest, at a reasonable rate, in ac- cordance with regulations of the corporation).
(d) SUFFICIENCY.—For purposes of this section—
(1) SUFFICIENCY FOR BENEFIT COMMITMENTS 120.—A single-
employer plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities if there is no amount of unfunded benefit liabilities under the plan.
(2) SUFFICIENCY FOR GUARANTEED BENEFITS.—A single-em- ployer plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits if there is no amount of unfunded guaranteed benefits under the plan.
(e) LIMITATION ON THE CONVERSION OF A DEFINED BENEFIT
PLAN TO A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN.—The adoption of an amendment to a plan which causes the plan to become a plan de- scribed in section 4021(b)(1) constitutes a termination of the plan. Such an amendment may take effect only after the plan satisfies the requirements for standard termination under subsection (b) or distress termination under subsection (c).
TERMINATION OF MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS
SEC. 4041A. ø1341a¿ (a) Termination of a multiemployer plan under this section occurs as a result of—
(1) the adoption after the date of enactment of the Multi- employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 øSeptember 26, 1980¿ of a plan amendment which provides that partici- pants will receive no credit for any purpose under the plan for service with any employer after the date specified by such amendment;
(2) the withdrawal of every employer from the plan, within the meaning of section 4203, or the cessation of the obligation of all employers to contribute under the plan; or
(3) the adoption of an amendment to the plan which causes the plan to become a plan described in section 4021(b)(1).
(b)(1) The date on which a plan terminates under paragraph
(1) or (3) of subsection (a) is the later of—
(A) the date on which the amendment is adopted, or
120 So in original. Section 7881(g)(1) of P.L. 101–239 amended the text to substitute ‘‘benefit liabilities’’ for ‘‘benefit commitments’’ but did not conform the heading accordingly.

of subsection (a) is the earlier of—
(A) the date on which the last employer withdraws, or
(B) the first day of the first plan year for which no em-
ployer contributions were required under the plan.
(c) Except as provided in subsection (f)(1), the plan sponsor of a plan which terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) shall—
(1) limit the payment of benefits to benefits which are non- forfeitable under the plan as of the date of the termination, and
(2) pay benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, only in the form of an annuity, un- less the plan assets are distributed in full satisfaction of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan.
(d) The plan sponsor of a plan which terminates under para-
graph (2) of subsection (a) shall reduce benefits and suspend ben- efit payments in accordance with section 4281.
(e) In the case of a plan which terminates under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a), the rate of an employer’s contributions under the plan for each plan year beginning on or after the plan termination date shall equal or exceed the highest rate of employer contributions at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan in the 5 preceding plan years ending on or before the plan termination date, unless the corporation approves a reduc- tion in the rate based on a finding that the plan is or soon will be fully funded.
(f)(1) The plan sponsor of a terminated plan may authorize the payment other than in the form of an annuity of a participant’s en- tire nonforfeitable benefit attributable to employer contributions, other than a death benefit, if the value of the entire nonforfeitable benefit does not exceed $1,750. The corporation may authorize the payment of benefits under the terms of a terminated plan other than nonforfeitable benefits, or the payment other than in the form of an annuity of benefits having a value greater than $1,750, if the corporation determines that such payment is not adverse to the in- terest of the plan’s participants and beneficiaries generally and does not unreasonably increase the corporation’s risk of loss with respect to the plan.
(2) The corporation may prescribe reporting requirements for terminated plans, and rules and standards for the administration of such plans, which the corporation considers appropriate to pro- tect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries or to pre- vent unreasonable loss to the corporation.
INSTITUTION OF TERMINATION PROCEEDINGS BY THE CORPORATION
SEC. 4042. ø1342¿ (a) The corporation may institute pro- ceedings under this section to terminate a plan whenever it deter- mines that—

mailed with respect to the tax imposed under section 4971(a) of such Code,
(2) the plan will be unable to pay benefits when due,
(3) the reportable event described in section 4043(c)(7) has occurred, or
(4) the possible long-run loss of the corporation with re- spect to the plan may reasonably be expected to increase un- reasonably if the plan is not terminated.
The corporation shall as soon as practicable institute proceedings under this section to terminate a single-employer plan whenever the corporation determines that the plan does not have assets available to pay benefits which are currently due under the terms of the plan. The corporation may prescribe a simplified procedure to follow in terminating small plans as long as that procedure in- cludes substantial safeguards for the rights of the participants and beneficiaries under the plans, and for the employers who maintain such plans (including the requirement for a court decree under sub- section (c)). Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the corporation is authorized to pool assets of terminated plans for pur- poses of administration, investment, payment of liabilities of all such terminated plans, and such other purposes as it determines to be appropriate in the administration of this title.
(b)(1) Whenever the corporation makes a determination under subsection (a) with respect to a plan or is required under sub- section (a) to institute proceedings under this section, it may, upon notice to the plan, apply to the appropriate United States district court for the appointment of a trustee to administer the plan with respect to which the determination is made pending the issuance of a decree under subsection (c) ordering the termination of the plan. If within 3 business days after the filing of an application under this subsection, or such other period as the court may order, the administrator of the plan consents to the appointment of a trustee, or fails to show why a trustee should not be appointed, the court may grant the application and appoint a trustee to admin- ister the plan in accordance with its terms until the corporation de- termines that the plan should be terminated or that termination is unnecessary. The corporation may request that it be appointed as trustee of a plan in any case.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title—
(A) upon the petition of a plan administrator or the cor- poration, the appropriate United States district court may ap- point a trustee in accordance with the provisions of this section if the interests of the plan participants would be better served
by the appointment of the trustee, and
(B) upon the petition of the corporation, the appropriate
United States district court shall appoint a trustee proposed by the corporation for a multiemployer plan which is in reorga- nization or to which section 4041A(d) applies, unless such ap- pointment would be adverse to the interests of the plan partici- pants and beneficiaries in the aggregate.
(3) The corporation and plan administrator may agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2).

(c)(1) If the corporation is required under subsection (a) of this section to commence proceedings under this section with respect to a plan or, after issuing a notice under this section to a plan admin- istrator, has determined that the plan should be terminated, it may, upon notice to the plan administrator, apply to the appro- priate United States district court for a decree adjudicating that the plan must be terminated in order to protect the interests of the participants or to avoid any unreasonable deterioration of the fi- nancial condition of the plan or any unreasonable increase in the liability of the fund. If the trustee appointed under subsection (b) disagrees with the determination of the corporation under the pre- ceding sentence he may intervene in the proceeding relating to the application for the decree, or make application for such decree him- self. Upon granting a decree for which the corporation or trustee has applied under this subsection the court shall authorize the trustee appointed under subsection (b) (or appoint a trustee if one has not been appointed under such subsection and authorize him) to terminate the plan in accordance with the provisions of this sub- title. If the corporation and the plan administrator agree that a plan should be terminated and agree to the appointment of a trust- ee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of this subsection (other than this sentence) the trustee shall have the power described in subsection (d)(1) of this section and, in addition to any other duties imposed on the trustee under law or by agree- ment between the corporation and the plan administrator, the trustee is subject to the duties described in subsection (d)(3). When- ever a trustee appointed under this title is operating a plan with discretion as to the date upon which final distribution of the assets is to be commenced, the trustee shall notify the corporation at least 10 days before the date on which he proposes to commence such distribution.

ALLOCATION OF ASSETS
SEC. 4044. ø1344¿ (a) In the case of the termination of a sin- gle-employer plan, the plan administrator shall allocate the assets of the plan (available to provide benefits) among the participants and beneficiaries of the plan in the following order:
(1) First, to that portion of each individual’s accrued ben- efit which is derived from the participant’s contributions to the plan which were not mandatory contributions.
(2) Second, to that portion of each individual’s accrued ben- efit which is derived from the participant’s mandatory con- tributions.
(3) Third, in the case of benefits payable as an annuity— (A) in the case of the benefit of a participant or bene- ficiary which was in pay status as of the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date of the plan, to each such benefit, based on the provisions of the plan (as in effect during the 5-year period ending on such date)
under which such benefit would be the least,
(B) in the case of a participant’s or beneficiary’s ben-
efit (other than a benefit described in subparagraph (A)) which would have been in pay status as of the beginning of such 3-year period if the participant had retired prior to the beginning of the 3-year period and if his benefits had commenced (in the normal form of annuity under the plan) as of the beginning of such period, to each such benefit based on the provisions of the plan (as in effect during the 5-year period ending on such date) under which such ben- efit would be the least.
For purposes of subparagraph (A), the lowest benefit in pay status during a 3-year period shall be considered the benefit in pay status for such period.
(4) Fourth—
(A) to all other benefits (if any) of individuals under
the plan guaranteed under this title (determined without regard to section 4022B(a)), and

Sec. 4044 ERISA 458
(1) The amount allocated under any paragraph of sub- section (a) with respect to any benefit shall be properly ad- justed for any allocation of assets with respect to that benefit under a prior paragraph of subsection (a).
(2) If the assets available for allocation under any para- graph of subsection (a) (other than paragraphs (4), (5), and (6)) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals which are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allo- cated pro rata among such individuals on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that paragraph.
(3) If assets available for allocation under paragraph (4) of subsection (a) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals who are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allocated first to benefits described in subparagraph (A) of that paragraph. Any remaining assets shall then be allo- cated to benefits described in subparagraph (B) of that para- graph. If assets allocated to such subparagraph (B) are insuffi- cient to satisfy in full the benefits described in that subpara- graph, the assets shall be allocated pro rata among individuals on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that subparagraph.
(4) This paragraph applies if the assets available for allo- cation under paragraph (5) of subsection (a) are not sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in that paragraph.
(A) If this paragraph applies, except as provided in subparagraph (B), the assets shall be allocated to the ben- efits of individuals described in such paragraph (5) on the basis of the benefits of individuals which would have been described in such paragraph (5) under the plan as in effect at the beginning of the 5-year period ending on the date of plan termination.
(B) If the assets available for allocation under sub- paragraph (A) are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in such subparagraph (without regard to this subparagraph), then for purposes of subparagraph (A), benefits of individuals described in such subparagraph shall be determined on the basis of the plan as amended by the most recent plan amendment effective during such 5-year period under which the assets available for alloca- tion are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individ- uals described in subparagraph (A) and any assets remain- ing to be allocated under such subparagraph shall be allo- cated under subparagraph (A) on the basis of the plan as amended by the next succeeding plan amendment effective during such period.
(5) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the al- location made pursuant to this section (without regard to this paragraph) results in discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 then, if re- quired to prevent the disqualification of the plan (or any trust under the plan) under section 401(a) or 403(a) of such Code, the assets allocated under subsections (a)(4)(B), (a)(5), and

(a)(6) shall be reallocated to the extent necessary to avoid such discrimination.
(6) The term ‘‘mandatory contributions’’ means amounts contributed to the plan by a participant which are required as a condition of employment, as a condition of participation in such plan, or as a condition of obtaining benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions. For this purpose, the total amount of mandatory contributions of a participant is the amount of such contributions reduced (but not below zero) by the sum of the amounts paid or distributed to him under the plan before its termination.
(7) A plan may establish subclasses and categories within the classes described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of sub- section (a) in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.
(c) Any increase or decrease in the value of the assets of a sin-
 gle-employer plan occurring during the period beginning on the later of (1) the date a trustee is appointed under section 4042(b) or (2) the date on which the plan is terminated is to be allocated between the plan and the corporation in the manner determined by the court (in the case of a court-appointed trustee) or as agreed upon by the corporation and the plan administrator in any other case. Any increase or decrease in the value of the assets of a single- employer plan occurring after the date on which the plan is termi- nated shall be credited to, or suffered by, the corporation.
(d)(1) Subject to paragraph (3), any residual assets of a single- employer plan may be distributed to the employer if—
(A) all liabilities of the plan to participants and their bene- ficiaries have been satisfied,
(B) the distribution does not contravene any provision of law, and
(C) the plan provides for such a distribution in these cir- cumstances.
(2)(A) In determining the extent to which a plan provides for the distribution of plan assets to the employer for purposes of para- graph (1)(C), any such provision, and any amendment increasing the amount which may be distributed to the employer, shall not be treated as effective before the end of the fifth calendar year fol- lowing the date of the adoption of such provision or amendment.
(B) A distribution to the employer from a plan shall not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph if the plan has been in effect for fewer than 5 years and the plan has provided for such a distribution since the effective date of the plan.
(C) Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Sec- retary of the Treasury, in any case in which a transaction de- scribed in section 208 occurs, subparagraph (A) shall continue to apply separately with respect to the amount of any assets trans- ferred in such transaction.
(D) For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘‘employer’’ in- cludes any member of the controlled group of which the employer is a member. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term ‘‘controlled group’’ means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m) or (o) of section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the portion of the re- maining assets which are attributable to employee contributions shall be an amount equal to the product derived by multiplying—
(i) the market value of the total remaining assets, by (ii) a fraction—
(I) the numerator of which is the present value of all portions of the accrued benefits with respect to partici- pants which are derived from participants’ mandatory con- tributions (referred to in subsection (a)(2)), and
(II) the denominator of which is the present value of all benefits with respect to which assets are allocated under paragraphs (2) through (6) of subsection (a).
(C) For purposes of this paragraph, each person who is, as of the termination date—
(i) a participant under the plan, or
(ii) an individual who has received, during the 3-year pe- riod ending with the termination date, a distribution from the plan of such individual’s entire nonforfeitable benefit in the form of a single sum distribution in accordance with section 203(e) or in the form of irrevocable commitments purchased by the plan from an insurer to provide such nonforfeitable benefit,
shall be treated as a participant with respect to the termination, if all or part of the nonforfeitable benefit with respect to such per- son is or was attributable to participants’ mandatory contributions (referred to in subsection (a)(2)).
(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the requirements of section 4980(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as in effect immediately after the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990) or section 404(d) of this Act with respect to any distribution of residual assets of a single-employer plan to the employer.
(e) BANKRUPTCY FILING SUBSTITUTED FOR TERMINATION DATE.—If a contributing sponsor of a plan has filed or has had filed against such person a petition seeking liquidation or reorganization in a case under title 11, United States Code, or under any similar Federal law or law of a State or political subdivision, and the case has not been dismissed as of the termination date of the plan, then subsection (a)(3) shall be applied by treating the date such petition was filed as the termination date of the plan.

more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control—
(1) shall notify the corporation of the withdrawal during a plan year of a substantial employer for such plan year from the plan, within 60 days after such withdrawal, and
(2) request that the corporation determine the liability of all persons with respect to the withdrawal of the substantial employer.
The corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, determine whether there is liability resulting from the withdrawal of the sub- stantial employer and notify the liable persons of such liability.
(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), any one or more con- tributing sponsors who withdraw, during a plan year for which they constitute a substantial employer, from a single-employer plan which has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, shall, upon notification of such con- tributing sponsors by the corporation as provided by subsection (a), be liable, together with the members of their controlled groups, to the corporation in accordance with the provisions of section 4062 and this section. The amount of liability shall be computed on the basis of an amount determined by the corporation to be the amount described in section 4062 for the entire plan, as if the plan had been terminated by the corporation on the date of the withdrawal referred to in subsection (a)(1), multiplied by a fraction—
(1) the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed to the plan by such contributing sponsors for the last 5 years ending prior to the withdrawal, and
(2) the denominator of which is the total amount required to be contributed to the plan by all contributing sponsors for such last 5 years.
In addition to and in lieu of the manner prescribed in the preceding sentence, the corporation may also determine such liability on any other equitable basis prescribed by the corporation in regulations. Any amount collected by the corporation under this subsection shall be held in escrow subject to disposition in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (c).
(c)(1) In lieu of payment of a contributing sponsor’s liability under this section, the contributing sponsor may be required to fur- nish a bond to the corporation in an amount not exceeding 150 per- cent of his liability to insure payment of his liability under this sec- tion. The bond shall have as surety thereon a corporate surety com- pany which is an acceptable surety on Federal bonds under author- ity granted by the Secretary of the Treasury under sections 6 through 13 of title 6, United States Code. Any such bond shall be in a form or of a type approved by the Secretary including indi- vidual bonds or schedule or blanket forms of bonds which cover a group or class.
(2) If the plan is not terminated under section 4041(c) or 4042 within the 5-year period commencing on the day of withdrawal, the liability is abated and any payment held in escrow shall be re- funded without interest (or the bond cancelled) in accordance with bylaws or rules prescribed by the corporation.

(A) demand payment or realize on the bond and hold such amount in escrow for the benefit of the plan;
(B) treat any escrowed payments under this section as if they were plan assets and apply them in a manner consistent with this subtitle; and
(C) refund any amount to the contributing sponsor which is not required to meet any obligation of the corporation with respect to the plan.
(d) The provisions of this subsection apply in the case of a
withdrawal described in subsection (a), and the provisions of sub- sections (b) and (c) shall not apply, if the corporation determines that the procedure provided for under this subsection is consistent with the purposes of this section and section 4064 and is more ap- propriate in the particular case. Upon a showing by the plan ad- ministrator of the plan that the withdrawal from the plan by one or more contributing sponsors has resulted, or will result, in a sig- nificant reduction in the amount of aggregate contributions to or under the plan, the corporation may—
(1) require the plan fund to be equitably allocated between those participants no longer working in covered service under the plan as a result of the withdrawal, and those participants who remain in covered service under the plan;
(2) treat that portion of the plan funds allocable under paragraph (1) to participants no longer in covered service as a plan terminated under section 4042; and
(3) treat that portion of the plan fund allocable to partici- pants remaining in covered service as a separate plan.
(e) The corporation is authorized to waive the application of
the provisions of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section when- ever it determines that there is an indemnity agreement in effect among contributing sponsors under the plan which is adequate to satisfy the purposes of this section and of section 4064.

(2) The liability imposed by section 4062, 4063, or 4064 may be collected by a proceeding in court if the proceeding is com- menced within 6 years after the date upon which the plan was ter- minated or prior to the expiration of any period for collection agreed upon in writing by the corporation and the liable person be- fore the expiration of such 6-year period. The period of limitations provided under this paragraph shall be suspended for the period the assets of the liable person are in the control or custody of any court of the United States, or of any State, or of the District of Co- lumbia, and for 6 months thereafter, and for any period during which the liable person is outside the United States if such period of absence is for a continuous period of at least 6 months.
(e) If the corporation determines that release of the lien or sub- ordination of the lien to any other creditor of the liable person would not adversely affect the collection of the liability imposed under section 4062, 4063, or 4064, or that the amount realizable by the corporation from the property to which the lien attaches will ultimately be increased by such release or subordination, and that the ultimate collection of the liability will be facilitated by such re- lease or subordination, the corporation may issue a certificate of re- lease or subordination of the lien with respect to such property, or any part thereof.
(f) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this section—
(1) The collective net worth of persons subject to liability
in connection with a plan termination shall be determined as provided in section 4062(d)(1).

(3) The corporation may by regulation exclude a group or class of employers described in the preceding sentence126 from the appli- cation of this subsection if the corporation determines that such ex- clusion is necessary—
(A) to protect the interest of the plan’s participants and beneficiaries, or
(B) to prevent a significant risk of loss to the corporation with respect to the plan.
(4) A plan may be amended to provide that this subsection
shall not apply to a group or class of employers under the plan. (d)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), in the case of an em-
ployer who—
(A) has an obligation to contribute under a plan described
in paragraph (2) primarily for work described in such para- graph, and
(B) does not continue to perform work within the jurisdic- tion of the plan,
a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in paragraph (3). (2) A plan is described in this paragraph if substantially all of the contributions required under the plan are made by employers primarily engaged in the long and short haul trucking industry, the household goods moving industry, or the public warehousing indus-
try.
(3) A withdrawal occurs under this paragraph if—
(A) an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan or permanently ceases all covered operations under the plan, and
(B) either—
(i) the corporation determines that the plan has suf-
fered substantial damage to its contribution base as a re- sult of such cessation, or
(ii) the employer fails to furnish a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 412, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the plan, in an amount equal to 50 percent of the withdrawal liability of the employer.
(4) If, after an employer furnishes a bond or escrow to a plan under paragraph (3)(B)(ii), the corporation determines that the ces- sation of the employer’s obligation to contribute under the plan (considered together with any cessations by other employers), or cessation of covered operations under the plan, has resulted in sub- stantial damage to the contribution base of the plan, the employer shall be treated as having withdrawn from the plan on the date on which the obligation to contribute or covered operations ceased, and such bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan. The corporation shall not make a determination under this paragraph more than 60 months after the date on which such obligation to contribute or covered operations ceased.
(5) If the corporation determines that the employer has no fur- ther liability under the plan either—

SALE OF ASSETS
SEC. 4204. ø1384¿ (a)(1) A complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (hereinafter in this section referred to as the ‘‘seller’’) under this section128 does not occur solely because, as a result of a bona fide, arm’s-length sale of assets to an unrelated party (here- inafter in this section referred to as the ‘‘purchaser’’), the seller ceases covered operations or ceases to have an obligation to con- tribute for such operations, if—
(A) the purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the same number of contribution base units for which the seller had an obligation to contribute to the plan;
(B) the purchaser provides to the plan for a period of 5 plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning after the sale of assets, a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 412 of this Act, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the plan, in an amount equal to the greater of—

(C) the contract for sale provides that, if the purchaser withdraws in a complete withdrawal, or a partial withdrawal with respect to operations, during such first 5 plan years, the seller is secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have had to the plan with respect to the operations (but for this section) if the liability of the purchaser with respect to the plan is not paid.
(2) If the purchaser—
(A) withdraws before the last day of the fifth plan year be-
ginning after the sale, and
(B) fails to make any withdrawal liability payment when
due,
then the seller shall pay to the plan an amount equal to the pay- ment that would have been due from the seller but for this section.

PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS
SEC. 4205. ø1385¿ (a) Except as otherwise provided in this sec- tion, there is a partial withdrawal by an employer from a plan on the last day of a plan year if for such plan year—
(1) there is a 70-percent contribution decline, or
(2) there is a partial cessation of the employer’s contribu- tion obligation.
(b) For purposes of subsection (a)—
(1)(A) There is a 70-percent contribution decline for any
plan year if during each plan year in the 3-year testing period the employer’s contribution base units do not exceed 30 percent of the employer’s contribution base units for the high base year.
(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)—
(i) The term ‘‘3-year testing period’’ means the period
consisting of the plan year and the immediately preceding 2 plan years.
(ii) The number of contribution base units for the high base year is the average number of such units for the 2 plan years for which the employer’s contribution base units were the highest within the 5 plan years imme- diately preceding the beginning of the 3-year testing pe- riod.

tribution obligation for the plan year if, during such year—
(i) the employer permanently ceases to have an obliga- tion to contribute under one or more but fewer than all col- lective bargaining agreements under which the employer has been obligated to contribute under the plan but con- tinues to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement of the type for which contributions were previously required or transfers such work to another location or to an entity or entities owned or controlled by
the employer, or

(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a cessation of obli-
gations under a collective bargaining agreement shall not be considered to have occurred solely because, with respect to the same plan, one agreement that requires contributions to the plan has been substituted for another agreement.
(c)(1) In the case of a plan in which a majority of the covered employees are employed in the retail food industry, the plan may be amended to provide that this section shall be applied with re- spect to such plan—
(A) by substituting ‘‘35 percent’’ for ‘‘70 percent’’ in sub- sections (a) and (b), and
(B) by substituting ‘‘65 percent’’ for ‘‘30 percent’’ in sub- section (b).
(2) Any amendment adopted under paragraph (1) shall provide rules for the equitable reduction of withdrawal liability in any case in which the number of the plan’s contribution base units, in the 2 plan years following the plan year of withdrawal of the employer, is higher than such number immediately after the withdrawal.
(3) Section 4208 shall not apply to a plan which has been amended under paragraph (1).

ADJUSTMENT FOR PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL
SEC. 4206. ø1386¿ (a) The amount of an employer’s liability for a partial withdrawal, before the application of sections 4219(c)(1) and 4225, is equal to the product of—
(1) the amount determined under section 4211, and ad- justed under section 4209 if appropriate, determined as if the employer had withdrawn from the plan in a complete with- drawal—
(A) on the date of the partial withdrawal, or
(B) in the case of a partial withdrawal described in section 4205(a)(1) (relating to 70-percent contribution de- cline), on the last day of the first plan year in the 3-year testing period,
multiplied by
(2) a fraction which is 1 minus a fraction—
(A) the numerator of which is the employer’s contribu- tion base units for the plan year following the plan year in which the partial withdrawal occurs, and
(B) the denominator of which is the average of the em- ployer’s contribution base units for—
(i) except as provided in clause (ii), the 5 plan years immediately preceding the plan year in which the partial withdrawal occurs, or
(ii) in the case of a partial withdrawal described in section 4205(a)(1) (relating to 70-percent contribu-

the beginning of the 3-year testing period.
(b)(1) In the case of an employer that has withdrawal liability for a partial withdrawal from a plan, any withdrawal liability of that employer for a partial or complete withdrawal from that plan in a subsequent plan year130 shall be reduced by the amount of any partial withdrawal liability (reduced by any abatement or re- duction of such liability) of the employer with respect to the plan
for a previous plan year.
(2) The corporation shall prescribe such regulations as may be
necessary to provide for proper adjustments in the reduction pro- vided by paragraph (1) for—
(A) changes in unfunded vested benefits arising after the close of the prior year131 for which partial withdrawal liability was determined,
(B) changes in contribution base units occurring after the close of the prior year132 for which partial withdrawal liability was determined, and
(C) any other factors for which it determines adjustment to be appropriate,
so that the liability for any complete or partial withdrawal in any subsequent year (after the application of the reduction) properly re- flects the employer’s share of liability with respect to the plan.
REDUCTION OR WAIVER OF COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY
SEC. 4207. ø1387¿ (a) The corporation shall provide by regula- tion for the reduction or waiver of liability for a complete with- drawal in the event that an employer who has withdrawn from a plan subsequently resumes covered operations under the plan or renews an obligation to contribute under the plan, to the extent that the corporation determines that reduction or waiver of with- drawal liability is consistent with the purposes of this Act.
(b) The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a procedure and standards for the amendment of plans to provide alternative rules for the reduction or waiver of liability for a complete with- drawal in the event that an employer who has withdrawn from the plan subsequently resumes covered operations or renews an obliga- tion to contribute under the plan. The rules may apply only to the extent that the rules are consistent with the purposes of this Act.

(B) If the plan sponsor determines under paragraph (1) that the employer has no further liability to the plan for the partial withdrawal, then the bond shall be cancelled.
(C) If the plan sponsor determines under paragraph (1) that the employer continues to have liability to the plan for the partial withdrawal, then—
(i) the bond shall be paid to the plan,
(ii) the employer shall immediately be liable for the out- standing amount of liability due with respect to the plan year for which the bond was posted, and
(iii) the employer shall continue to make the partial with- drawal liability payments as they are due.

plies;
(2) the plan provides, or is amended to provide, that the

METHODS FOR COMPUTING WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY
SEC. 4211. ø1391¿ (a) The amount of the unfunded vested ben- efits allocable to an employer that withdraws from a plan shall be determined in accordance with subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this sec- tion.
(b)(1) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that with- draws is the sum of—
(A) the employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amount of the change in the plan’s unfunded vested benefits for plan years ending after September 25, 1980, as determined under paragraph (2),
(B) the employer’s proportional share, if any, of the unamortized amount of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits at the end of the plan year ending before September 26, 1980, as determined under paragraph (3); and
(C) the employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amounts of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits (if any) as determined under paragraph (4).
If the sum of the amounts determined with respect to an employer under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) is negative, the unfunded vested benefits allocable to the employer shall be zero.
(2)(A) An employer’s proportional share of the unamortized amount of the change in the plan’s unfunded vested benefits for plan years ending after September 25, 1980, is the sum of the em- ployer’s proportional shares of the unamortized amount of the change in unfunded vested benefits for each plan year in which the employer has an obligation to contribute under the plan ending—
(i) after such date, and
(ii) before the plan year in which the withdrawal of the employer occurs.
(B) The change in a plan’s unfunded vested benefits for a plan year is the amount by which—
(i) the unfunded vested benefits at the end of the plan year; exceeds
(ii) the sum of—
(I) the unamortized amount of the unfunded vested

under this section during those plan years.
(4)(A) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to
an employer under this paragraph is equal to the sum of—
(i) the plan’s unfunded vested benefits which are attrib- utable to participants’ service with the employer (determined as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which
the employer withdraws), and
(ii) the employer’s proportional share of any unfunded
vested benefits which are not attributable to service with the employer or other employers who are obligated to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws (determined as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer with- draws).
(B) The plan’s unfunded vested benefits which are attributable to participants’ service with the employer is the amount equal to the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan which are at- tributable to participants’ service with such employer (determined under plan rules not inconsistent with regulations of the corpora- tion) decreased by the share of plan assets determined under sub- paragraph (C) which is allocated to the employer as provided under subparagraph (D).
(C) The value of plan assets determined under this subpara- graph is the value of plan assets allocated to nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with the employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, which is deter- mined by multiplying—
(i) the value of the plan assets as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, by

(i) an amount equal to—
(I) the value of all nonforfeitable benefits under the
plan at the end of such plan year, reduced by
(II) the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan
at the end of such plan year which are attributable to par- ticipants’ service with employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan for such plan year; reduced by (ii) an amount equal to—

(G) The corporation may prescribe by regulation other methods which a plan may adopt for allocating assets to determine the amount of the unfunded vested benefits attributable to service with the employer and to determine the employer’s share of unfunded vested benefits not attributable to service with employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year in which the employer withdraws.
(5)(A) The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a proce- dure by which a plan may, by amendment, adopt any other alter- native method for determining an employer’s allocable share of un- funded vested benefits under this section, subject to the approval of the corporation based on its determination that adoption of the method by the plan would not significantly increase the risk of loss to plan participants and beneficiaries or to the corporation.
(B) The corporation may prescribe by regulation standard ap- proaches for alternative methods, other than those set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, which a plan may adopt under subparagraph (A), for which the corporation may waive or modify the approval requirements of subparagraph (A). Any alter- native method shall provide for the allocation of substantially all of a plan’s unfunded vested benefits among employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan.
(C) Unless the corporation by regulation provides otherwise, a plan may be amended to provide that a period of more than 5 but not more than 10 plan years may be used for determining the nu- merator and denominator of any fraction which is used under any method authorized under this section for determining an employ- er’s allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under this section.
(D) The corporation may by regulation permit adjustments in any denominator under this section, consistent with the purposes of this title, where such adjustment would be appropriate to ease administrative burdens of plan sponsors in calculating such de- nominators.
(E) FRESH START OPTION.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a plan may be amended to provide that the withdrawal liability method described in subsection (b) shall be ap- plied by substituting the plan year which is specified in the amendment and for which the plan has no unfunded vested benefits for the plan year ending before September 26, 1980.

(f) In the case of a withdrawal following a merger of multiem- ployer plans, subsection (b), (c), or (d) shall be applied in accord- ance with regulations prescribed by the corporation; except that, if a withdrawal occurs in the first plan year beginning after a merger of multiemployer plans, the determination under this section shall be made as if each of the multiemployer plans had remained sepa- rate plans.
OBLIGATION TO CONTRIBUTE; SPECIAL RULES
SEC. 4212. ø1392¿ (a) For purposes of this part, the term ‘‘obli- gation to contribute’’ means an obligation to contribute arising—
(1) under one or more collective bargaining (or related) agreements, or
(2) as a result of a duty under applicable labor-manage- ment relations law, but
does not include an obligation to pay withdrawal liability under this section or to pay delinquent contributions.
(b) Payments of withdrawal liability under this part shall not be considered contributions for purposes of this part.
(c) If a principal purpose of any transaction is to evade or avoid liability under this part, this part shall be applied (and liability shall be determined and collected) without regard to such trans- action.
ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, ETC.
SEC. 4213. ø1393¿ (a) The corporation may prescribe by regula- tion actuarial assumptions which may be used by a plan actuary in determining the unfunded vested benefits of a plan for purposes of determining an employer’s withdrawal liability under this part. Withdrawal liability under this part shall be determined by each plan on the basis of—
(1) actuarial assumptions and methods which, in the ag- gregate, are reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations) and which, in combina- tion, offer the actuary’s best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan, or
(2) actuarial assumptions and methods set forth in the cor- poration’s regulations for purposes of determining an employ- er’s withdrawal liability.
(b) In determining the unfunded vested benefits of a plan for
purposes of determining an employer’s withdrawal liability under this part, the plan actuary may—
(1) rely on the most recent complete actuarial valuation used for purposes of section 412 of Internal Revenue Code of

(2) in the absence of complete data, rely on the data avail- able or on data secured by a sampling which can reasonably be expected to be representative of the status of the entire plan.
(c) For purposes of this part, the term ‘‘unfunded vested bene-
fits’’ means with respect to a plan, an amount equal to—
(A) the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan, less (B) the value of the assets of the plan.
APPLICATION OF PLAN AMENDMENTS
SEC. 4214. ø1394¿ (a) No plan rule or amendment adopted after January 31, 1981, under section 4209 or 4211(c) may be ap- plied without the employer’s consent with respect to liability for a withdrawal or partial withdrawal which occurred before the date on which the rule or amendment was adopted.
(b) All plan rules and amendments authorized under this part shall operate and be applied uniformly with respect to each em- ployer, except that special provisions may be made to take into ac- count the creditworthiness of an employer. The plan sponsor shall give notice to all employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan and to all employee organizations representing em- ployees covered under the plan of any plan rules or amendments adopted pursuant to this section.
PLAN NOTIFICATION TO CORPORATION OF POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT WITHDRAWALS
SEC. 4215. ø1395¿ The corporation may, by regulation, require the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan to provide notice to the corporation when the withdrawal from the plan by any employer has resulted, or will result, in a significant reduction in the amount of aggregate contributions under the plan made by employers.

(B) the product of—
(i) the number of contribution base units for which
the employer would have been required to make con- tributions for the prior plan year if the employer had not withdrawn, multiplied by

(c)(1)(A)(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (D) of this paragraph and in paragraphs (4) and (5), an employer shall pay the amount determined under section 4211, adjusted if appro- priate first under section 4209 and then under section 4206 over the period of years necessary to amortize the amount in level an- nual payments determined under subparagraph (C), calculated as if the first payment were made on the first day of the plan year following the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs and as if each subsequent payment were made on the first day of each sub- sequent plan year. Actual payment shall commence in accordance with paragraph (2).
(ii) The determination of the amortization period described in clause (i) shall be based on the assumptions used for the most re- cent actuarial valuation for the plan.
(B) In any case in which the amortization period described in subparagraph (A) exceeds 20 years, the employer’s liability shall be limited to the first 20 annual payments determined under subpara- graph (C).
(C)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (E), the amount of each annual payment shall be the product of—
(I) the average annual number of contribution base units for the period of 3 consecutive plan years, during the period of 10 consecutive plan years ending before the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs, in which the number of contribution base units for which the employer had an obligation to con- tribute under the plan is the highest, and
(II) the highest contribution rate at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan during the 10 plan years ending with the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs.

(II) Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any plan year to which this clause applies.
(III) This clause shall not apply in the case of any withdrawal described in subparagraph (D).
(IV) If under a plan this clause applies to any plan year but does not apply to the next plan year, this clause shall not apply to any plan year after such next plan year.
(V) For purposes of this clause, the term ‘‘required contribu- tions’’ means, for any period, the amounts which the employer was obligated to contribute for such period (not taking into account any delinquent contribution for any other period).
(iii) A plan may be amended to provide that for the first plan year ending on or after September 26, 1980, the number ‘‘5’’ shall be substituted for the number ‘‘10’’ each place it appears in clause (i) or clause (ii) (whichever is appropriate). If the plan is so amend- ed, the number ‘‘5’’ shall be increased by one for each succeeding plan year until the number ‘‘10’’ is reached.
(D) In any case in which a multiemployer plan terminates by the withdrawal of every employer from the plan, or in which sub- stantially all the employers withdraw from a plan pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw from the plan—
(i) the liability of each such employer who has withdrawn shall be determined (or redetermined) under this paragraph without regard to subparagraph (B), and
(ii) notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the total unfunded vested benefits of the plan shall be fully allo- cated among all such employers in a manner not inconsistent with regulations which shall be prescribed by the corporation.
Withdrawal by an employer from a plan, during a period of 3 con- secutive plan years within which substantially all the employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan withdraw, shall be presumed to be a withdrawal pursuant to an agreement or arrangement, unless the employer proves otherwise by a prepon- derance of the evidence.
(E) In the case of a partial withdrawal described in section 4205(a), the amount of each annual payment shall be the product of—
(i) the amount determined under subparagraph (C) (deter- mined without regard to this subparagraph), multiplied by
(ii) the fraction determined under section 4206(a)(2).
(2) Withdrawal liability shall be payable in accordance with the schedule set forth by the plan sponsor under subsection (b)(1) beginning no later than 60 days after the date of the demand not- withstanding any request for review or appeal of determinations of
the amount of such liability or of the schedule.
(3) Each annual payment determined under paragraph (1)(C)
shall be payable in 4 equal installments due quarterly, or at other intervals specified by plan rules. If a payment is not made when due, interest on the payment shall accrue from the due date until the date on which the payment is made.

suant to a withdrawal which is later determined to be part of a withdrawal described in paragraph (1)(D), the withdrawal liability of the employer shall not be limited to the amount of the prepay- ment.
(5) In the event of a default, a plan sponsor may require imme- diate payment of the outstanding amount of an employer’s with- drawal liability, plus accrued interest on the total outstanding li- ability from the due date of the first payment which was not timely made. For purposes of this section, the term ‘‘default’’ means—
(A) the failure of an employer to make, when due, any pay- ment under this section, if the failure is not cured within 60 days after the employer receives written notification from the plan sponsor of such failure, and
(B) any other event defined in rules adopted by the plan which indicates a substantial likelihood that an employer will be unable to pay its withdrawal liability.
(6) Except as provided in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), interest under
this subsection shall be charged at rates based on prevailing mar- ket rates for comparable obligations, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.
(7) A multiemployer plan may adopt rules for other terms and conditions for the satisfaction of an employer’s withdrawal liability if such rules—
(A) are consistent with this Act, and
(B) are not inconsistent with regulations of the corpora- tion.
(8) In the case of a terminated multiemployer plan, an employ- er’s obligation to make payments under this section ceases at the end of the plan year in which the assets of the plan (exclusive of withdrawal liability claims) are sufficient to meet all obligations of the plan, as determined by the corporation.
(d) The prohibitions provided in section 406(a) do not apply to any action required or permitted under this partor to any arrange- ment relating to withdrawal liability involving the plan.

(b) An amendment permitted by section 4211(c)(5) may be adopted only in accordance with that section.
(c) The corporation shall disapprove an amendment referred to in subsection (a) or (b) only if the corporation determines that the amendment creates an unreasonable risk of loss to plan partici- pants and beneficiaries or to the corporation.

SEC. 4221. ø1401¿ (a)(1) Any dispute between an employer and the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan concerning a determina- tion made under sections 4201 through 4219144 shall be resolved through arbitration. Either party may initiate the arbitration pro- ceeding within a 60-day period after the earlier of—
(A) the date of notification to the employer under section 4219(b)(2)(B), or
(B) 120 days after the date of the employer’s request under section 4219(b)(2)(A).
The parties may jointly initiate arbitration within the 180-day pe- riod after the date of the plan sponsor’s demand under section 4219(b)(1).
(2) An arbitration proceeding under this section shall be con- ducted in accordance with fair and equitable procedures to be pro- mulgated by the corporation. The plan sponsor may purchase in- surance to cover potential liability of the arbitrator. If the parties have not provided for the costs of the arbitration, including arbitra- tor’s fees, by agreement, the arbitrator shall assess such fees. The arbitrator may also award reasonable attorney’s fees.
(3)(A) For purposes of any proceeding under this section, any determination made by a plan sponsor under sections 4201 through 4219 and section 4225 is presumed correct unless the party con- testing the determination shows by a preponderance of the evi- dence that the determination was unreasonable or clearly erro- neous.
(B) In the case of the determination of a plan’s unfunded vest- ed benefits for a plan year, the determination is presumed correct unless a party contesting the determination shows by a preponder- ance of evidence that—
(i) the actuarial assumptions and methods used in the de- termination were, in the aggregate, unreasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expecta- tions), or
(ii) the plan’s actuary made a significant error in applying the actuarial assumptions or methods.
(b)(1) If no arbitration proceeding has been initiated pursuant
to subsection (a), the amounts demanded by the plan sponsor under section 4219(b)(1) shall be due and owing on the schedule set forth by the plan sponsor. The plan sponsor may bring an action in a State or Federal court of competent jurisdiction for collection.
(2) Upon completion of the arbitration proceedings in favor of one of the parties, any party thereto may bring an action, no later than 30 days after the issuance of an arbitrator’s award, in an ap- propriate United States district court in accordance with section 4301 to enforce, vacate, or modify the arbitrator’s award.
(3) Any arbitration proceedings under this section shall, to the extent consistent with this title, be conducted in the same manner, subject to the same limitations, carried out with the same powers (including subpena power), and enforced in United States courts as
144 So in original. There is no reference to section 4225 in paragraph (1) despite the reference made to that section in paragraph (3)(A).

ployer has occurred, or
(ii) an employer is liable for withdrawal liability
payments with respect to the complete or partial with- drawal of an employer from the plan,
(B) such determination is based in whole or in part on
a finding by the plan sponsor under section 4212(c) that a principal purpose of a transaction that occurred before January 1, 1999, was to evade or avoid withdrawal liabil- ity under this subtitle, and
(C) such transaction occurred at least 5 years before the date of the complete or partial withdrawal,
then the special rules under paragraph (2) shall be used in ap- plying subsections (a) and (d) of this section and section 4219(c) to the employer.

a finding by the plan sponsor under section 4212(c) that a principal purpose of any transaction which occurred after December 31, 1998, and at least 5 years (2 years in the case of a small employer) before the date of the complete or partial withdrawal was to evade or avoid withdrawal li- ability under this subtitle,
then the person against which the withdrawal liability is as- sessed based solely on the application of section 4212(c) may elect to use the special rule under paragraph (2) in applying subsection (d) of this section and section 4219(c) to such per- son.
(2) SPECIAL RULE.—Notwithstanding subsection (d) and section 4219(c), if an electing person contests the plan spon- sor’s determination with respect to withdrawal liability pay- ments under paragraph (1) through an arbitration proceeding pursuant to subsection (a), through an action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction for review of such an arbitra- tion decision, or as otherwise permitted by law, the electing person shall not be obligated to make the withdrawal liability payments until a final decision in the arbitration proceeding, or in court, upholds the plan sponsor’s determination, but only if the electing person—
(A) provides notice to the plan sponsor of its election to apply the special rule in this paragraph within 90 days after the plan sponsor notifies the electing person of its li- ability by reason of the application of section 4212(c); and
(B) if a final decision in the arbitration proceeding, or in court, of the withdrawal liability dispute has not been rendered within 12 months from the date of such notice, the electing person provides to the plan, effective as of the first day following the 12-month period, a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 412 of this Act, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satis- factory to the plan, in an amount equal to the sum of the withdrawal liability payments that would otherwise be due under subsection (d) and section 4219(c) for the 12-month period beginning with the first anniversary of such notice.

(A) the employer’s unattributable liability,
(B) the employer’s withdrawal liability payments which would have been due but for section 4208, 4209, 4219, or 4225, 146

(B) The amounts paid by a plan to a fund shall be deemed a
reasonable expense of administering the plan under sections 403(c)(1) and 404(a)(1)(A)(ii), and the payments made by a fund to a participating plan shall be deemed services necessary for the op- eration of the plan within the meaning of section 408(b)(2) or with- in the meaning of section 4975(d)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

standard accounts (and minimum contribution requirements), amounts paid from the plan to fund shall be applied to reduce the amount treated as contributed to the plan.
(e) The fund shall be subrogated to the rights of the plan against the employer that has withdrawn from the plan for amounts paid by a fund to a plan under—
(1) subsection (c)(1)(A), to the extent not credited under subsection (d)(1)(A), and

of the fund shall discharge the fiduciary’s duties with respect to the fund in accordance with the standards for fiduciaries prescribed by this Act (to the extent not inconsistent with the purposes of this section), and in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the fund insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this Act (to the extent not incon- sistent with the purposes of this section). The provisions of the pre- ceding sentence shall supersede any and all State laws relating to fiduciaries insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to a fund to which this section applies.

(c) The merger of multiemployer plans or the transfer of assets
or liabilities between multiemployer plans, shall be deemed not to constitute a violation of the provisions of section 406(a) or section 406(b)(2) if the corporation determines that the merger or transfer otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section.

(4) The corporation may make equitable arrangements with multiemployer plans which are liable under this subsection for sat- isfaction of their liability.
(d) Benefits under a single-employer plan to which liabilities are transferred in accordance with this section are guaranteed under section 4022 to the extent provided in that section as of the effective date of the transfer and the plan is a successor plan.

Section 108(a)(3)(C) of division O of Public Law 113–235 provides for an amendment to part 3 of subtitle D of title IV to strike the heading and insert ‘‘INSOLVENT PLANS’’. The amend- ment was not carried out because it should have been made to part 3 of subtitle E of title IV.
Section 108(a)(1) of division O of Public Law 113–235 provides for an amendment to strike sections 4241 through 4244A.

(B) For purposes of this paragraph—
(i) the term ‘‘person in pay status’’ means—
(I) a participant or beneficiary on the last day of the base plan year who, at any time during such year, was paid an early, late, normal, or disability retire- ment benefit (or a death benefit related to a retire- ment benefit), and

(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), if a plan sponsor deter- mines in writing a resource benefit level for a plan year which is below the level of basic benefits, the payment of all benefits other than basic benefits must be suspended for that plan year.
(4)(A) If, by the end of an insolvency year, the plan sponsor de- termines in writing that the plan’s available resources in that in- solvency year could have supported benefit payments above the re- source benefit level for that insolvency year, the plan sponsor shall distribute the excess resources to the participants and beneficiaries who received benefit payments from the plan in that insolvency year, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘‘excess resources’’ means available resources above the amount necessary to support the resource benefit level, but no greater than the amount nec- essary to pay benefits for the plan year at the benefit levels under the plan.
(5) If, by the end of an insolvency year, any benefit has not been paid at the resource benefit level, amounts up to the resource benefit level which were unpaid shall be distributed to the partici- pants and beneficiaries, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, to the extent possible taking into account the plan’s total available resources in that insolvency year.
(6) Except as provided in paragraph (4) or (5), a plan is not re- quired to make retroactive benefit payments with respect to that portion of a benefit which was suspended under this section.
(d)(1) As of the end of the first plan year in which a plan is in critical status, as described in subsection 305(b)(2),,156 and at least every 3 plan years thereafter (unless the plan is no longer in critical status, as described in subsection 305(b)(2),)156, the plan sponsor shall compare the value of plan assets for that plan year with the total amount of benefit payments made under the plan for that plan year. Unless the plan sponsor determines that the value of plan assets exceeds 3 times the total amount of benefit pay- ments, the plan sponsor shall determine whether the plan will be insolvent in any of the next 5 plan years. If the plan sponsor makes such a determination that the plan will be insolvent in any of the next 5 plan years, the plan sponsor shall make the comparison under this paragraph at least annually until the plan sponsor makes a determination that the plan will not be insolvent in any of the next 5 plan years.
(2) If, at any time, the plan sponsor of a plan in critical status, as described in subsection 305(b)(2), reasonably determines, taking into account the plan’s recent and anticipated financial experience, that the plan’s available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits under the plan when due for the next plan year, the plan sponsor shall make such determination available to interested parties.

poses of this subsection is the rate specified in section 303(h)(2)(C)(iii) (disregarding modifications made under clause (iv) of such section) for the month in which the application for special financial assistance is filed by the eligible multiem- ployer plan or the 3 preceding months, with such specified rate increased by 200 basis points.

EFFECTIVE DATE; SPECIAL RULES
SEC. 4402. ø1461¿ (a) The provisions of this title take effect on the date of enactment of this Act øSeptember 2, 1974¿.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the cor- poration shall pay benefits guaranteed under this title with respect to any plan—
(1) which is not a multiemployer plan,
(2) which terminates after June 30, 1974, and before the date of enactment of this Act øSeptember 2, 1974¿,
(3) to which section 4021 would apply if that section were effective beginning on July 1, 1974, and
(4) with respect to which a notice is filed with the Sec- retary of Labor and received by him not later than 10 days after the date of enactment of this Act øSeptember 2, 1974¿, except that, for reasonable cause shown, such notice may be filed with the Secretary of Labor and received by him not later than October 31, 1974, stating that the plan is a plan de- scribed in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).
The corporation shall not pay benefits guaranteed under this title with respect to a plan described in the preceding sentence unless the corporation finds substantial evidence that the plan was termi- nated for a reasonable business purpose and not for the purpose of obtaining the payment of benefits by the corporation under this title or for the purpose of avoiding the liability which might be im- posed under subtitle D if the plan terminated on or after the date of enactment of this Act øSeptember 2, 1974¿. The provisions of subtitle D do not apply in the case of such a plan which terminates before the date of enactment of this Act øSeptember 2, 1974¿. For purposes of determining whether a plan is a plan described in paragraph (2), the provisions of section 4048 shall not apply, but the corporation shall make the determination on the basis of the date on which benefits ceased to accrue or on any other reasonable basis consistent with the purposes of this subsection.

The provisions consist of amendments adding a subsection (g) to section 404 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, relating to certain employer liability pay- ments considered as contributions and adding a paragraph (8) to section 6511(d) of such Code, relating to special period of limitation with respect to amounts included in income subsequently recaptured under qualified plan termination. Both added provisions have since received further amendment.

(3) Notwithstanding any provision of section 4021 or 4022 which would prevent such payments, the corporation, in carrying out its authority under paragraph (2), may pay benefits guaranteed under this title with respect to a multiemployer plan described in paragraph (2) in any case in which those benefits would otherwise not be payable if—
(A) the plan has been in effect for at least 5 years,
(B) the plan has been in substantial compliance with the funding requirements for a qualified plan with respect to the employees and former employees in those employment units on the basis of which the participating employers have contrib- uted to the plan for the preceding 5 years, and
(C) the participating employers and employee organization or organizations had no reasonable recourse other than termi- nation.
(4) If the corporation determines, under paragraph (2) or (3),
that it will pay benefits guaranteed under this title with respect to a multiemployer plan which terminates before August 1, 1980, the corporation—
(A) may establish requirements for the continuation of payments which commenced before January 2, 1974, with re- spect to retired participants under the plan,
(B) may not, notwithstanding any other provision of this title, make payments with respect to any participant under such a plan who, on January 1, 1974, was receiving payment of retirement benefits, in excess of the amounts and rates pay- able with respect to such participant on that date,
